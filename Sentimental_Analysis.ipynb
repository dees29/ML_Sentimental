Seat had coat hook, USB and AC power ports, and 10 inch entertainment system. Double armrests and extra storage spaces for water bottles or other items.', 'There are differences between aircraft from same model (A330-300 in this case).

You expect a bit better seat and at least personal screen.', \"I did not find the seats on A332 as comfortable as on Aeroflot's A319/320 fleet.

On the other hand personal entertainment system keeps you occupied therefore long flights are bearable.\", \"Leg room is average although the seats recline well.

Seat pitch was too tight seat do not recline no Inflight TV. nothing good to say. I will avoid Rouge flights.', 'We paid for Preferred seats row 12 window and middle on the flight from Newark to Vancouver. The seat diagram online showed a bulkhead wall in front of the seats but in reality there was no wall and the business seats had a tiny curtain from the top of the seats. We knew the arm rests would not go up but we assumed there would be a wall of some type. So when the business seats reclined we had very limited leg room. The middle seat had no pocket because the view was straight down the whole business class section between the seats. We would have been better off in a regular seat which at least has arm rests that go up. I complained to Air Canada and all they offered was a 15% coupon for a future flight but with major restrictions. The reply from customer relations even stated that a discounted fare would be cheaper than applying the coupon to the full fare. This is the second time we received coupons we could not use as compensation. We will avoid Air Canada in the future.', 'Just done five flights with them in the last three weeks. The seats are crammed in so tight. I am not a big guy but I struggled with the lack of room. Four out of the five flights the entertainment did not work. There was no food included on any of the flights including a seven hour flight. Will never fly with them again.', 'The movie selections were not great but the seat was fine I am quite tall and i had an etiquette amount of leg room. This was a 14 hour flight from Sydney to Vancouver.', 'Although we were flying Premium Economy to London (LHR) via Montreal (YUL) there were no PE seats on this CRJ. The only concession to this from AC was giving us \"preferred seats\" 12A and 12C. It is difficult to maneuver in and out of these seats. Typically this is a small jet and everything about it just reads \"cramped.\" There is no IFE. We were supposed to get complimentary snacks but the attendants overlooked this entirely.', 'My spouse and I were flying to/from LHR via YUL; our outbound trip was at the end of July and home trip in early September. These seats are located immediately behind a service bulkhead and afford a lot of legroom. The IFES and table tray are located in the armrests as is the remote control for the IFES and overhead lights etc. We found the trays easy to deploy but it took both arms and a lot of effort to get the IFES unit out of the armrest. When deployed it was difficult to view as it was somewhat offset by the armrest or the tray (if deployed). The remote control is on wired tether which often tangled with other items and accidentally turned lights on or off or called cabin crew unnecessarily - annoying. The seats are leather-faced and comfortable. An amenities kit is provided with pillow and blanket. The seats are close to washrooms. When cabin crew were accessing the bulkhead storage there was a tendency to hit my feet with the door. Also this is a service area for c rew so it can be noisy as can be the sounds of passengers walking to and from the washrooms. Overhead storage is plentiful. Meals were excellent as was the crew service. For overseas flights it is worthwhile paying extra for the comfort. If we had to do this again we would probably choose seats farther back in this 24-seat cabin to avoid the bulkhead closet crew activity and washroom sounds.', 'YUL-YYZ. Although we were flying Premium Economy from YWG-YUL-LHR and return there were no PE seats on this aircraft. As a concession AC assigns PE passengers to \"preferred seats\" so in our case this was 12D and 12E which is immediately behind Business Class on this 120-seat aircraft. Boarding this flight was a zoo with many passengers dragging huge carry on luggage and scrambling to find space. As we were in a bulkhead row there is no under seat storage so we also had to scramble to stow our carry ons (just a few small bags by the way). Curiously as the IFES is tied to the seats in front of you that meant there were only two screens for three Economy passengers. The seats have 35\" pitch as opposed to 31-33\" in non -preferred seats. Still not particularly comfortable but it is what it is.', 'My spouse and I were flying Premium Economy (PE) YWG-YUL-LHR-YUL-YYZ-YWG late August (Outbound) and early September (inbound). Air Canada as a concession to passengers flying in aircraft without PE seating assigned us to \"preferred seats\" which in this case was 12A and 12C which were immediately behind the business class section of the cabin. Boarding was reasonably efficient but hampered by the rush of passengers scrambling to find storage for their massive carry ons. As we had no under seat storage we also had to scramble to ensure our few small carry ons were stowed. Our IFES and almost everyone else\\'s on the port side of the aircraft did not work; AC did give us vouchers which when filed on line gave us a 5% discount on future bookings until spring 2015. Legroom was comfortable and our seats had 3\" more pitch than other Economy class seats; but this is a small aircraft (better than a CRJ) and things still felt cramped. It was just tolerable for the 2.5 hour flight to YWG.', 'I sat in seat 23E from YVR-YYZ and this seat configuration is horrible. This is a middle seat and you are constantly pressing against your neighbours on both sides. There is also a support strut directly in front of you so your feet are in a \"shared\" space. This is a big step backward for Air Canada on a long-haul flight and I will take every possible precaution to avoid this configuration in future travel.', \"For an 8 hour flight to Paris from Montreal the seats were pretty good. I also liked Air Canada's new 3 cabin interior on this flight. The seat recline was pretty good and I was able to sleep for awhile. enRoute systems were amazing much better than the older system.\", 'Air Canada have gone with a very poor seat design both from the perspective of comfort and functionality. The width of the seats has been reduced and there is no usable armrest space. Plus in their wisdom controls for the PTV screen have been placed on top of the armrests (so you are inadvertently putting the overhead light on calling the flight attendant or changing channel). In addition the headphone jack for the PTV is next to the screen so the cabin staff are catching cables when serving trays (in the limited space) etc.', 'The XM interior that Air Canada introduced a few years ago remains one of my favorite. It provides everything you would expect out of a North American Economy class seat. The pitch is beyond generous and I am able to easily stretch out and the width is acceptable. The entertainment system is also excellent offering a wide variety of entertainment options. Beyond ordinary economy class.', 'Air Canada reconfigured some B777-300 to squeeze more seats. Economy class was changed from 3x3x3 configuration to 3x4x3. Seats shrank from 18.5\" wide to 17\". It\\'s impossible to not touch the neighbors. Also less space for legs and I suspect the seats recline less.', 'Flew in 18B 11-28-13 YYC-YVR which was bad enough but AC used to fly the E190 PDX-YYZ and back which is dreadful for a flight that long in a narrow body. AC has no respect for their Star Alliance FF so I avoid flying them if possible because there is no Economy Plus seating with them. They even tried to charge me for luggage this trip. The CRJ is more comfortable than the E190 in my opinion.', 'Food was so-so. Water offering was quite skimpy. Toilets very small. Seats got very hard by the end of the flight. Viewing screen was very difficult to see.', 'Good legroom no in flight entertainment component box under the seat in front as with some airlines). Seat recline satisfactory and adjustable headrest of good quality and adjustment.', 'Heathrow to Vancouver and seats were comfortable enough and legroom good.

Legroom was sufficient for a trip across the Atlantic (7 hours). I do not think the extra room in Premium Economy is worth the extra money - just a couple of extra inches of pitch, although the seat is wider. Seats recline. I would not fly across the Atlantic in a regular economy seat however. The pitch is very tight. Padding was sufficient - I slept on both outbound and inbound flights. Overhead storage was adequate.

The seats on Rouge are called \"New Slimline Seats\" and they definitely are slimline especially on the cushion aspect as well as much narrower since they have jammed 3 seats across into the same space that used to have 2 across. There is absolutely no lumbar support so lower backpain is the reward after a couple of hours. 2 other aspects about the seats the actual length front to back of the seat is less than normal so no support for the upper thighs which can be problematic for some.

But the most impressive thing is the HD screen! In Economy Class, having a such beautiful screen is uncommon. The seat recline is not the best I have known but that is correct.

I flew LAX-CDG and back and liked it a lot. I mean the legroom is absolutely dazzling and the seat recline was great (well I am short) and the shell seat is great because you do not have to have the seat in front of you in your face. If you feel like you are not lucky to be in this small cabin (the upper deck one is the only one on the plane) look at the economy passengers behind you! I felt like how low the seats were made it so that it was a bit difficult to view the screen. But this was hardly noticeable. Again I am short!', 'LAX to CDG was hell!

This row is immediately behind the one behind a bulkhead (i.e. behind the row often given to families - we were lucky to have a quiet family in front who slept as well as we did). Passengers on those rows generally do not recline their seats so much due to the extra space in front of them consequently we in turn did not feel so trapped in our seats as passengers further back may have done - our seats did not recline as much as some on other aircraft but we did not find this a problem. Worth mentioning that the food was excellent too!', 'We flew CDG to SGL and then EZE to CDG the same torture unbelievable. This was unfortunately the most uncomfortable seat I sat in on a long haul flight. The seat looks good on the website when first looking at it. Air France makes its Premium Economy a real additional class. There are fewer seats per row. The seat is designed so that you have real isolated private space. You also have quite a lot legroom. Unfortunately the design of the seat itself is an outright disaster. The seat area itself is way too short even for short people. The seat hardly reclines at all. The footrest leaves your feet in an awkward cramped position if you do not happen to be extremely short - shorter than 160 cm like me. However not using the footrest will have your feet dangling in mid air. There is a leg rest that you can swing out but since the seat is too short it will hardly support anything. The seat is a disaster or an overnight long haul flight. Air France should feel ashamed charging extra for these seats. And it is not peanuts for us it was almost the double compared to Economy class fare.', 'Decent legroom but very uncomfortable. I had high hopes with it being my first flight on the A380 and it being a large modern aircraft. The recline was almost non-existent. Also I really could not understand how the tv screen could be so badly designed.

There is a leg rest that you can swing out but since the seat is to short it will hardly support anything. The whole seat design feels strangely like a business class seat for small children. Because of the legroom the good entertainment system and the private space this seat is probably an option for a day flight where seating comfort does not matter much. For an overnight long haul it is just a disaster.', 'Seat number 30A the last row of this particular section meaning almost no recline or legroom.

I agree that the recline on these seats is not great but the width of the seat and the fact that no one reclines their seat into your lap was worth the extra money. I was able to sleep comfortably for the majority of the flight. My husband is 5\"10 and was able to stretch out and sleep comfortably in the seat. The service was great. Flight attendants were attentive but not bothersome. We were on the upper deck which felt cozy with easy access to the snack bar and bathrooms. Food and wine with dinner was good.

In addition the premium economy cabin was in very poor condition with obvious wear and tear that compromised some seat functions (such as the leg rest).

In addition on two separate long-haul flights one of the two toilets was not working.', 'Not close to worth the added expense. As noted in other posts the seats are rock-hard and the recline feature is either not functioning or awkward and uncomfortable. On both A380 and 777 they looked good from a distance but showed incredible wear and inattention to maintenance. In a word shabby. Customer service was nonexistent as to seat selection and my wife and I were arbitrarily separated on both LAX-CDG and return. No one could do anything about it despite requests weeks before the flights days before flights or at check-in. The only real benefit was the priority boarding but I had rather save my money and upgrade to business. This is no alternative.', 'I flew with Air France from San Francisco to Paris. The premium economy seat on this flight is the worst seat I have ever experienced. No recline the seat just drops a few inches when you push the recline button. Also the seat is hard as a rock; it is more comfortable to sit on a park-bench. To add insult to injury the entertainment-screen did not work.', 'The seat did not actually recline it sort of slid down and the front edge of the bottom seat cushion moved forward. However it did not reach a position which was comfortable. The \"footrest\" was terrible it was really a \"legrest\" that only extended about 2/3 the way from my knees to my ankles but all it did was press against my calves and cut off the circulation. It was also difficult to put back had to press hard against it with my legs while pushing a button on the inside arm of the seat. The table which was stored in the seat arm did not slide forward enough to provide room between it and my stomach - I am not particularly large so I do not know how someone who is heavier would even manage to use the table. I had to have the seat completely in the upright position to be able to use the table at all and it was rather awkward trying to eat with it that close. Also the seat adjustment buttons are right under where the table hinges so it is essentially impossible to adjust the seat when the table is out. We were sitting in the first row on the right side of the plane so had lots of legroom; I give the normal seats 4 of 5 based on my observation but I am not very tall so do not need a lot of legroom. The video screen was in the other arm of the seat position when out was OK but not great a little low and of course off center.', 'Adequate width. Hardly any recline. Seat bsase moves forward slightly and back rest moves with it to provide a minimum but not a comfortable amount. Lower part of seat doubles as a rest for upper legs (activated by button on seat). Base of seat in front has foot rest. However the seats are so close together than when the seat is in the reclined position and the leg rest raised it is impossible- even to rest feet on for rest as it is too close. I am of short stature and I was unable to sit comfortably for this reason. I found it necessary either to have my feet supported which led to fatigue in the upper legs or to have my upper legs supported meaning that my feet were \"dangling\". Sleep was possible but only just. Lights from other passengerÃ‚Â´ seats and screens is very intrusive and impedes sleep. Everything is very close together giving no sense of privacy. The seat rows are so close that anyone sitting away from the aisle can only exit if the passenger on the aisle seat moves which is inconvenient for all. Unlike other reviewers I did not suffer any back pain or other serious discomfort but did not feel rested. The seat I had originally been assigned to was broken- the lower left rest disengaged and rose immediately I sat down - the latching mechanism was defective. This problem could not be sorted out before departure. However I was able to move to the next seat in the row. If this had not been the case then I suspect I would not have been allowed to use the seat during take off and landing since I could not sit in the \"upright\" position. Also the raised footrest would have impeded exit of the passenger sitting in the middle seat posing a safety hazard. The seats appeared to be superior to the economy seats as far as the width was concerned. However I do not consider the extra cost to be justified. The price differential compared to what is on offer is far higher than e.g. from economy to business.', 'After 40 years of intensive international travel I can safely say that these are the worst seats I have ever had the misfortune to occupy. In addition to which the service was almost non-existent and definitely not worth the premium price over a regular Y Class seat.', 'Seat 91k is a seat plus beside the more available legroom i do not know what the plus stands for. Seats is hard to hard actually and narrow but this is what you get in coach class.', '11 hour flight from Paris to Mauritius the seats were rock hard and very little leg room to move about in.

Unfortunately we had flown to Paris 4 weeks before and it was exactly the same for this our return journey so we knew what we could expect.', 'Shanghai-Paris and return - seats are narrow and require more padding. Both flights- tried looking cabins (showing wear & tear) and very poor IFE. I was quite surprised that Air France would operate these tried looking B777 on the Shanghai route.

Finally the crew were surly disinterested and impolite.', 'It was a bulkhead seat (17H on 777-300ER) right behind the business class cabin. Seat recline is ok and legroom is good. The seat width however was horrible. First reduced due to the tray table in armrest on top of that the remote for entertainment console is also placed in armrest and the holder pokes about an inch into the seat. Uncomfortable to get in or out of the seat and nearly impossible to reposition yourself without getting out if you are slightly on the heavier side. Better for people who feel comfortable in 16 inch seat width. The entertainment screen is folded on a swiveling arm which folds behind your feet. It was quite hard to move it into position (joints were hard) and amazingly the joint which is supposed to holed the screen upright was super smooth! At initial deployment of the screen I had just started watching something with my legs crossed over each other and the screen fell (swiveled on a horizontal axis at the bottom side of the screen) and hit my shin quite hard. For the rest of the flight I was rubbing my shin (and keeping the blanket folded many times on my leg to prevent any further injury due to the screen). I forgot to mention that the controls in the remote which was poking my thigh did not function. Not just on my seat at least 6 more seats around me had the same issue. Thankfully the touchscreen menu on the personal screen was working which enabled me to watch a movie (not much more as the system response was very sluggish and music browse menu quite user unfriendly to use satisfactorily).', 'One of the middle seats disgraceful for a flag carrier. Almost as bad as Emirates 777 - the only difference is the footrest on AF. Never again.', \"The Premier Voyageur cabin is intimate in size but spacious. While the seats in this class are far superior to those in coach class there are drawbacks. The fixed seat shell is marvelous as passengers do not encroach into other passengers' space but the recline mechanism could be improved to provide greater comfort. I fly the LAX-CDG route annually and it is annoying that on every trip the passenger sitting behind me kept their window shades open or kept their reading light on throughout the flight. There should be a period during the flight when passengers should be able to sleep. The service as always (at least in my experience flying AF) is superior. The food can be questionable but I will likely order the special meals for my next trip which appear to be superior to the standard meals offered.\", 'Flight from Paris to Hong Kong.

It's in the narrower part of the aircraft at the rear so there are only 2 seats instead of 3 on the windows side. IFE box was under the seat in front of me but to I was not too bothered by it. The seat is away from the cabin wall and this gives you several windows and a sensation of space. You get your own storage space between the seat and the wall which can also serve as a table. Although it will be shared with the person behind you. Getting things in and out of it means removing anything sitting on top. The IFE was okay selection of programs was fair.

Throughout the entire trip from Miami to Paris I was lucky if I was able to sleep for 20 minutes.

They are hard. The recline is very limited when it works and the fixed head rest is too low to support the head of anyone with any height. These problems were compounded by the failure to carry extension belts which fit the short seat-belts fitted on the second and third of the three rows (I was able to use the belt on the A319 on the connecting flight without difficulty). I therefore had to be transferred to the front row. This has a bulkhead which diminishes the value of the extra leg-room when the seat is upright: when I tried to use the (limited) recline an extension came out which pinned my feet to the bulkhead. In short this cabin is over-priced offering less than the preferred seats in the Air Canada Economy cabin', \"AF seats narrow and hard and it was very difficult to get comfortable. Also I have short legs and the absence of a footrest is a real problem - I had to place cushions on the floor & place my feet on them to ensure adequate circulation in my legs.

On the other hand I would rate AF ahead of Qantas's mediocre international economy offerings.\", 'I flew in the A380 going from CDG to IAD and then came back in the A330 ORD to CDG. The 380 seat was spacious with a large screen while the A330 was cramped and had the tiniest of screens.

I did not feel comfortable putting my seat all way back in consideration of the person behind. The seats also lead to people behind pulling on your seat when they try and get up and down from these cramped positions. I will try and avoid this aircraft in the future on AF.', '11hr flight from Paris Orly to La Reunion. By far the narrowest seat I have ever sat in. I think it was even narrower than the seats on Ryanair which is a budget airline. Legs were pressed right into back of the seat in front and when they reclined it was game over. Never again.

Eleven and a half hours of misery.', 'Aisle seat at emergency exit so legroom not a problem. Seat is the narrowest I have ever sat on - perhaps it is slightly narrower than all the other economy seats to incorporate the tray table in the armrest? Also the hardest seat I ever experienced.

Given cramped seating and the harness of the seat I will never choose Air France for intercontinental travel again.', 'CDG to HKG with B777-300 and HKG to CDG with B777-200. Economy class on the day to HKG from CDG was full. Very cramped cabin with 3x4x3 configuration. The seat on the aircraft was like wooden bench. I felt that the seat on B777-200 on the way back to CDG was a bit better. Has AF improved the seat? Either way their economy seat is far from satisfactory. Also on the way back to CDG they ran out of food available between first and second meal. If you take a long haul flight with AF make sure that you take some food with you just like the time you take a budget airline.', 'CDG-LIS on A320. Very little legroom for a 6.2 ft. tall. One of the worst experiences compared to most European airlines.', 'I was stunned to find the seats so miserably uncomfortable for an intercontinental flight. The seats were extremely narrow short and very hard with very little leg room. It became impossible for me to get comfortable in any way to be able to relieve pressure on my legs or sleep on my flight. There was absolutely zero room for anyone to get out of his/her seat to go to the restroom without having the entire row get up as well to let them out. I will never fly with Air France again because of this level of discomfort.', 'Premium economy Paris-Osaka for 11 hours. I sat at the front of the premium economy cabin. Pros- more legroom than the standard premium economy seats. Cons the tray tables are in the arms and not as large as the normal seats which makes working on a laptop a little less convenient. Overall I would certainly choose this seat again. I had a day flight both ways so did not try to sleep. Seat was comfortable for the duration and I did not find it too hard. As I was working most of the flight I did not use the recline much but it seemed OK. The laptop power is standard 240V and either a standard French type or US plug will fit. It is limited in power and my laptop which is fairly low power would only work if the battery was taken out. That said the supply never faltered. Video was good with a reasonable large screen (although nobody could describe it as pin sharp) and a good choice of current films and TV shows. The earphones are OK but I used my own which plugged into a single 3.5mm socket so there was no need for an adapter. Service was OK not bad but not exceptional and the food was standard economy fare OK but nothing to get excited about. Overall a very pleasant flight and I do not think that I would have had much of a better flight in business class (but I was not trying to sleep). Overall plenty of room good comfort and easy boarding disembarking. Highly recommended.', 'Flew the new AF Premium economy product. Pros: hard shell seat gives feeling of extra space and good AV (with noise reducing headphones and slot for own \\'phones). Socket for laptop also handy tho\\' not used by me. Seat reclines (actually it \"declines\" in its shell) enough to aid sleep. Ticket class enables you to access AF lounge at CDG for a fee. The seat is very thin and very uncomfortable over a long flight. I bought a cushion in SCL for the return route but still had \"numb bum\". This detracts heavily from an otherwise good product. Please AF put some more padding in the seat cushion!', 'Extremely disappointing for 12hr flight. Marginally better on return but could be due to pain killers I took.', 'Entertainment is excellent. But the seat configuration on B777-300 at 3x4x3 makes it hard to survive after a 11 hours flight. AF should definitely think about passenger confort. I will never board those 777 again and I will prefer to choose another airline than AF on my next long haul flights to HKG and ICN.', '12 hours from Hong Kong to Paris was awful - my seat would not recline very far as I was in front of the toilet - the seat width was the worst ever as was the pitch (especially when reclining). 3x4x3 is not the normal seating configuration on a 777 which explains why it was so cramped even for someone as short as I am.', 'This BOS-CDG flight was the worst transatlantic flight I have ever taken. Very cramped seats I am small (5\\'2\") not obese and could barely fit into it. When person next to me pressed on arm rest it pinced my thigh enough to make me jump once or twice. Seat so cramped that I could hardly move around to relieve pressure on legs. Will never take this particular flight again.', 'I was quite surprised at just how bad the seating was aboard our Air France 747. I consider myself to be of average build and height and fairly fit yet squeezing into the seat was incredibly difficult. There was approximately one inch of space between my knees and the seat in front far less than the majority of short-haul flights I make. Extricating myself from the seat to get to the bathroom involved disturbing the two people sat next to me who were forced to get out of their seat and pile into the galley area because I wanted to leave. After the problems I faced when I first attempt to get out of my seat I gave in and remained stationary for the remainder of the flight. I dread to think how unpleasant the flight would have been if I was over 6 feet or weighed more than average. I have since recommended that all of my friends and colleagues avoid Air France at all costs.', 'CDG-Tokyo. It was the worst flight in my life. The seat was hard enough to feel like sitting on a plastic chair. My back was very painful after a 12hr flight. I chose the flight because it was the first time to fly with them and was the only flight departing Tokyo in late evening. I never fly their B777-300ER 3x4x3 layout aircraft again.', 'Perfect flight but way too narrow seating in eco/tempo. No chance to get a sleep under these conditions. Not recommended.', 'CDG-JFK. Much better seating compared to Air France 777 models. I recommend choosing the 330 if possible.', 'CDG to Tokyo - the narrowest Y seat I ever experienced. Took the flight because it was cheap turned out to be a mistake. Never ever want to fly on such a cramped plane again horrible.', 'Very tight seat pitch for long haul travel and not recommended at all. If in economy try to obtain an exit row seat or seat 31K.', 'Seats felt very cramped - worst I have ever experienced. Who is the genius that decided to put in new thickly padded and sculpted seats (which push you closer to the seat in front) with the most recline I have ever seen in Economy but kept the seat pitch at 31-32\"? When the seat in front reclined the video screen was 8\" in front of my face and it is impossible to reach the floor or stand up for that matter. It is ridiculously tight unless you are under 5\\'6\".', 'Not only would I not recommend these seats I will never fly on Air France again. I have never seen seats so close together. There was no leg room and I am not a large person. As for the recline - the head of the passenger in front of me was practically in my lap.', 'I had an aisle seat. The seat itself was comfortable even for me at 2 meters tall and there was just sufficient legroom. The problem was being an aisle seat people kept bumping into me all night long. Not just passengers but the crew as well. The aisle is only sixteen inches wide. The passengers shoulders protrude beyond the back of the seat. I complained to the crew and they said it was not their fault. They said it was a huge problem for them and the airline just would not listen. I resent being bumped into like this. Normally an airline crew would apologise but I guess if you are bumping into people all the time you would never get any work done apologising all night. Very disappointing when other aspects of the flight were excellent. I checked the ATR aisle width and it is 19 inches. A lot less people and a lot less movement of people about the cabin', 'I review this seat before I have even travelled in it. Booked a spacesaver seat on 777-300 on Friday, paid my money. Further to negative comments on this site about Air New Zealand changing aircraft type decided to check out this before travel. Sure enough, they have changed to an old 777-200, no space seat, usual old seat. Been ripped off before I even fly.', \"We purchased Brisbane to LAX return via Auckland. Our premium economy booking specifically stated SpaceSeat and the space seat was the entire reason for our booking. After boarding realised that we were on a777-200 so no space seats. Instead a very poor premium economy seat. Another passenger asked about the 300. In a rehearsed reply the attendant said 'oh that is on another route this aircraft is new. 'Never again.\", 'I am not a tall person at 5\\'4\" and have a slim build but I found the seats in economy were small too close to the seats in front and had no footrest. There was not even enough room to place my small cabin bag under the seat in front so I could elevate my feet. The pocket in front of my seat was so small you could hardly put anything in it and if you did you had to take it out to get up from your seat. I was unfolding my tray on this flight just as the person in front was reclining with the result of a good whack on my knees. I have never experience this before. I was extremely disappointed with the layout of this smart plane. There appears to be too much room in Premium Economy and far too little in Economy. There were only two toilets servicing our area of the plane.', 'My wife and I have flown with Air New Zealand from Canada to Queenstown using premium economy since 2006. While the Premium Economy price is considerably more than the economy we have willingly paid the difference for the comfort experienced on the long haul. Over the years we have experienced a variety of seating arrangements from the noticeable wider seats with more leg room to the \"moon seats\" which proved extremely uncomfortable and ultimately to the 777-200 flight which offered us the worst imaginable flight experience. The seats on our last trip to Queenstown and return were much narrower. We questioned our memory of past flights and finally checked the economy seats. Unfortunately economy seats did not look smaller than the premium economy. Our trip on January 4th this year to Queenstown found us on the long haul flight bumping elbows as we sat. There was no extra room to turn to choose a comfortable spot for sleeping. To use the phrase \"disappointing\" with reference to our latest trip and my own flight to Queenstown last May of 2014 is an understatement. The cost of our travel from Toronto to Queenstown was very close to $10000 for two adults. When advised by two friends who also traveled to Queenstown one week after us that their individual economy fares were in the region of $2500 each I am left wondering why so much was paid for so little. The premium economy accommodation would seem to be excessive in light of the meagre room afforded to your patrons of this class. I would be interested to know why customer care has been cut back and to what end. The crew are wonderful and every attempt is made within the cabin to accommodate travellers. Too bad that travel space is now cramped for premium economy patrons.', \"NZ2 (AKL-LAX) Seat 46D. One of the most uncomfortable long flights of my life. The seats are extremely uncomfortable with poor cushioning. Couldn't get comfortable at all. Front pouch space is a joke. Cant put anything there. Had to put my cellphone on the floor. I drink water quite a bit on long flights and there was no cup holder like on other planes (usually on under side of tray). Had to bring down the tray to put my water cup. Unhappy with AirNZ cabin layout.\", \"We flew Brisbane to Auckland and then on to San Francisco (I wish they flew direct from AU to the USA rather than transiting through NZ though). I am 186cm tall and fairly solidly built but found these Spaceseats very comfortable. Their 777-300 planes are beautifully presented and the crew are always so friendly and helpful. I hate flying long haul as I find the seats so uncomfortable on other airlines. We flew Qantas PE to LA last year via Sydney on their A380 and found the whole experience very average. What I love about the Spaceseat is that you do not have some clown reclining into your personal space forcing your food into your face or spilling your drink. The TV screen is fine just move it to a better position. There is plenty of room even for larger folk. It's so comfortable and the cabin is nice and private. The purple beanbag/footrest is very welcome. Flip your shoes off and settle in. The only thing that could be improved is the recline seating should be electronic buttons rather than manual. Ignore the negative reviews you will love this seat! Add to that the exceptional Air NZ service and you cannot go wrong. I look forward to trying the PE in their new 787 planes but somehow feel that it will be a step backwards.\", 'If you are considering the Air New Zealand premium economy option do not waste your money. I have flown this class with other providers without concern but the \"spaceseat\" is the most uncomfortable and worst ergonomic design My wife and I have ever experienced. There is no foot rest very poor reclining and tilt options and poor head rest design. The spaceseat provides NO place to put things (except my glasses case) any drink bottle book etc had to go on the floor or in the overhead locker. The diagonal configuration creates a number of problems you need to twist at an odd angle to watch your video screen or if you extend it out on the arm it ends up very close to your face and prevents you leaving the seat without disturbing the person next to you. The video remote is located in the seat by your elbow as a result is very easy to activate the functions when attempting to sleep (no chance too uncomfortable) I managed to turn on my screen and overhead lights and call the flight attendant all when trying to sleep. If you own a motor bike and lock it up with a huge chain you will appreciate the seat belt design . Air NZ staff were very good as was the food and wine. But the seats I felt I had spend 12 hours on the rack in some castle dungeon. You have been warned go economy and buy 3 seats between two.', 'We had a sky couch and as I am 6 foot 4 inches this was really a waste of time other than having an extra seat between the two of us. We just could not get comfortable on the flight to get in a sleeping position. The sky couch is rendered virtually useless when the seats in front fully recline and reduce the seating space dramatically. There were two sets of people on our side of the plane with sky couch but neither used it. I made the mistake of booking a sky couch rather than an exit row that would have been a better and cheaper option for us. Air New Zealand pack an extra seat in economy and this reduces the width of seat and that may make an uncomfortable journey for wide people.', 'Close to toilets means disturbance when trying to sleep. Queuing random bumping from crew and other passengers and light from the toilet door all contribute. Slightly less recline due to partition wall behind.', 'These new refit by Air NZ are a horrific experience on a long haul. The narrowest seats with the least legroom I have measured. Less room and smaller than Air Asia seats. When reclined cannot see the PTV screen as the angle is wrong. Guy next to me was half on top of me. I was in the isle seat and was kept awake the entire trip by people bumping into me. People behind me were banging into the back rest and its impossible to recline because then you are right on top of the person behind. It was a nightmare trip and I had jet lag for days after. My advice is to not travel on this aircraft at all on long haul flight.', 'I am a fairly frequent flyer on many different airlines. This is the most uncomfortable flight I have ever experienced. Very little seat width or leg room but worst of all the seat offers absolutely no lumber/lower back support. I chose to stand at the back of the plane for over 20 mins of the flight to give my self some relief from the discomfort.', 'Premium Economy Auckland to LAX and one of the best long haul flights we have experienced. We scored an upgrade (paid) to Business on the way back and although the ability to sleep on an actual bed on an overnight flight was a real plus we found there was a lot less personal space in Business compared to Premium Economy. The downside was having to fly economy-class Auckland to Adelaide (single class plane only). I literally had to get out the seat 3 times during the 4 hour flight as my leg became so numb I was concerned any longer locked in that position would lead to serious health issues. I was unable to point my foot upwards and had to sit locked in a splayed position whilst seated. I cannot imagine how I would have coped with a 12 hour flight in that position.', \"Trans Tasman economy class seating isvery tight. I do not think I have every been in an aircraft with such small space. Absolutely no leg room. (I'm male 5'11) If the pax in front reclines during meal service you will be wearing it and video screen ends up 6 inches from your face.\", \"I fly often usually on Qantas where I am Gold or Virgin Australia. This last trip 2 days ago I needed a fast direct flight so chose Air New Zealand. I paid an extra $95 for an exit row (air New Zealand are now an upscale budget airline with a cost for everything yet still charge. Premium fare)' the seat although had plenty of leg room is very very narrow more so than I ever remembered in the past and more narrow than the other airlines I fly. It was hard not to come into contact with the person beside me and we are both not big people. The recline is almost non- existent and both seat pouches are beside the window making it hard for the person in the aisle. All in all I was very disappointed in what I thought were an above average airline.\", 'This is specific to the Air New Zealand SkyCouch. Do Not believe the sales job on their website. The notion of paying premium price for two adults in three seats to be able to lay down is a joke. This would accommodate one adult at the most. This is being marketed for adults and families to lay down on long-haul flights. It is frustratingly cramped and the expectation set by the marketing makes it worse. The flight attendants have obviously dealt with this before as they started apologizing before we took off from LHR to LAX. We should have known something was wrong as the LHR ground staff would not look us in the eye when we asked about the SkyCouch seating. Shame on Air New Zealand.', 'The flight between the Cook Islands and Auckland had the most uncomfortable seats I have ever traveled in. Armrests do not incline for added comfort if seat is empty next to you. Inclination is practically nil and trying to grab a wink is impossible due to this as you pitch forward when nodding off.', 'I was put in row 52. When seat in front reclined effective space disappeared. Intolerable. Had to ask them to straighten seat or risk an incident. Temperature in this part of the plane was too hot. At back of plane it was freezing. No air control to regulate personal comfort. I am only 1.62 m yet I found these seats claustrophobic and restricting to a degree worse than older plane layouts. A six foot passenger next to me had to sit with knees splayed further restricting my available space.', 'Worst flight ever 9.5 hours of being cramped and uncomfortable. Paid $300 per person to have guaranteed empty seat next to us which cabin staff ignored woke up to find someone sitting in the empty seat. Once this was pointed out to staff they did move her. Guy in front of me was fidgeting and moving up and down tv was about 5cm in front of my face during dinner not so much cattle class as sardine class.', \"We flew to LA from London initially outbound in economy. While the seats themselves were nice and comfy the one downside is that if you have your seat up and the person in front reclines you have a TV screen inches from your face which made for a incredibly uncomfortable journey. On the return trip we tried the skycouch (2 adults travelling) and there is much improvement depending on what you want to use it for. We reclined the seats back and put it into 'bed' mode. For us this was fine as my girlfriend was happy to sit upright in the isle seat which allowed me to lay across the 3 seats. The extra width was lovely and made for a far more comfortable journey (even for my girlfriend who was now able to put her feet up also. The people in front did not recline giving us more space but the problem would still exist with the screen being close if they had and because of this I think if 2 people were to lay side by side with the seat in front reclined it would make it more like a coffin for one person. Saying that if you want to take turns with laying out then I would highly recommend paying the bit extra for have more sitting/laying options and generally more comfort. We are flying again with ANZ on the same journey and have booked the hard shell space seat to see if this improves the journey. I could not find a fault with the rest of the airline staff entertainment and food were all first class hence why we are flying again.\", 'I did a lot of research before I booked theAir New Zealand space seat to LA and back - on the way out we sat in the middle section seats that sort of curved slightly - the seats were amazing the recline is more of a slide and the controls are a bit stiff but when you get the hang of it they are fine the table and TV all moved about as did the arm rests the big middle armrest between the seats is great too - the seatbelts have an airbag so they are a bit bulky at one end - the bean bag for your feet was a bit flat and small - but on the return journey I had a much bigger bean bag. Leg room was fantastic but you do sort of angle a bit so it feels a bit odd twisting one way with your tv etc angled at the other but you get used to it - on the way back we were sat in the window seats and they are not like the middle ones they are off set from each other so there is more privacy I did find these ones had a little less room for your arm/elbow on the joining side but nothing major - there was also plenty of room to get in and out of your seat and it felt very spacious I was really impressed with the whole experience on this flight the seats the services everything was special and I highly recommend it.', 'We had to ask for assistance from cabin staff every time to try to get recliner seat activated - they did apologise and said there has been problems with this - but it is not fixed! On the first flight over to USA the cabin was not at full capacity and I tried other seating on other rows and experienced the same discomfort. Having been on both the inside and middle seating - there is no difference in comfort and I defy anyone to be seated in the middle seats as shown in the brochure in the seat pocket - I did try and it is impossible. Sleeping was almost non existent due to the headrest being too rigid.', 'Took a flight from AKL-HKG. Was seated in 44A and 44B (Economy Class). The seat started well but started to get really uncomfortable in the last half of the flight. Air New Zealand have improved their staff service so that when it is catering time all seats must be put into upright position so everyone could eat propoly. Overall good seats.', \"Premium Economy Row 24 middle 2 seats Heathrow to Auckland via LAX in October. Excellent seats. I was pretty concerned as when they were launched they received a lot of negative press as the legroom was alleged to be awful. Air New Zealand removed a row of seats in August to remedy this. It worked - I am 6'5 and with legs fully stretched could just about touch the back of the footwell - so loads of legroom. The recline could be a tad better but did not prevent me sleeping. The hard shell means your space is not intruded by the seat in front.\", 'Had to be the worst seats I have been in. If the person in front of you reclines they are just inches from your face. Plus people who seem to feel the need to constantly push back in their seat makes your table shake making for an unpleasant dining experience. It was very difficult to get in and out of the seat and I was in an aisle seat. I have bruises on my legs and my right knee bruised from knee being up against the seat in front of me. The armrests do not go completely up so I can see the other passengers being bruises from banging against them every time they try to get in and out of their seats. Worst seating. I got off my flight bruised and with a very sore and stiff neck.', 'The new space seat - pros and cons. I have travelled in both an inside and outside seat on the right and left of the two aisles and not the odd-looking away-facing pairs in the centre so my comments apply to the former. You sit at an angle of about 20 degrees to the aisle with the backs of the seat shells in front of you at the normal (right angle) to the aisle. This means that your TV (which can just about compensate for the off-centreness) and your tray table (which can\\'t) are at a weird angle. The window seats have better leg room than the aisle ones but the down side is that getting out - particularly if the \\'aisle\\' person has the TV out on its angled stilts and the tray table open (no rim glassholder or recess- beware!) is a mountaineering job - but at least using the shell in front as a lever will not disturb the occupants Air New zealand are obviously sensitive about it as on both flights the concierge were on the defensive (unsolicited on my last flight) - \"We\\'ve taken one row of seats out\" (Heaven knows what it was like before). But despite them being a bit hard one can get quite comfortable. Lovely big pillows and a \\'bean bag\\' for you feet. Just be prepared to eat off centre.', 'Row 29 middle row-right aisle spaceseat. I am 5\\' 10\" (177cm) and found there to be ample legroom when seated and reclined. Before the flight I was concerned about the outward facing nature of the seat but that proved to be a non-issue. TV monitor and tray table are detachable/adjustable to compensate for the angle of your seat. I did find it hard to find a comfortable sleeping position and the jury is still out on \"otto\" the foot bean bag - in some positions it was great and in others did not seem to be useful at all.', \"Seat 46 A/B/C have fixed armrests between them not even a 45 degree lift! Passengers really are trapped in their seats. Seats in front recline brings the person in front into your face and body unless you recline your seat too - and I am not a big person! Service etc. was excellent but poor seating provision makes this a no-go for long haul flights. Some economy seats had retractable armrests but most had minimal retraction - row 46 none! Passengers should be advised on seat maps - we booked months in advance and had the worst seats on the flight thanks to a check in clerk who moved us to supposedly 'better seats'. We travel this route regularly and will try to avoid Air New Zealand if they do not wake up and do better in future.\", 'This was on the brand new B777-300 (only the 5th flight!) sitting in the newly configured Premium Economy window. The seats on the sides are angled towards the outside. Leg room is worse than in the previous Premium Economy. All looks very fancy in white (why white? This is going to look grey and shabby very quickly!) but the seats are hard no squab not easy to recline and viewing position awful. Will avoid this class at all costs!', 'It was a new plane the seat was in a shell - the recline did not effect the seat behind good amount of room. 100% better than the 777-200', 'I took several flights with Air North in April, using their Aurora Pass. The flights north of Whitehorse were on the HS748. The flights themselves were fine, but did they really have to cram 10 rows of seats into a space meant for 9? 10 rows of seats, 9 rows of overhead lights/air vents that did not quite line up, and these seats are also quite narrow. Incidentally, seating is unreserved on these flights. Cabin bag limit is very small on this aircraft, but you can ask the FA to stow your bag in the rear - you will need all the space under your seat, and there is not much room in the open rack above.', 'The worst seat I have ever had on a trans Tasman flight. Arm rests do not fully retract up making it very hard to get in and out of your seat. If the seat next to you is empty the fact that the armrest will not fully retract makes it impossible to use the extra space! Seat was hard insufficient legroom seat to narrow.', 'The benefit of these 747\\'s is the 34\" seat pitch. 2\" more than on the 777s. Having sat in the seat for some 24 hours it was getting uncomfortable towards the end of the journey but at least you are invited to stretch your legs by walking around the cabin. Seat recline is good and your leg space is not seriously compromised when the seat in front is reclined fully back. Economy is never going to be really comfortable but the seat pitch offered by Air New Zealand goes a long way to making it more bearable.', 'I had paid a fraction of the cost as part of an upgrade from London to Auckland. The 777s as noted before suffer from having the same layout as economy but the seats are better. The airline I gather is going to re-configure these aircraft during 2009 - not before time. The service and food made for a very good flight and the seat was comfortable enough for the flight from Tokyo. Those paying full rates for this service may feel it does not reach the required standards of seat comfort though', 'Worst long haul flight with Air New Zealand I have made. Added to the awful seat pitch was the fact that the armrests which usually recede completely into the seat backs no longer do so. So although the flight was only half full it was impossible to utilise the spare seats next to me. On a 13.5 hours flight from SFO to AKL this becomes very important. Food and service okay but if the seats are diabolical then everything else pales into insignificance.', \"I have travelled Premium Economy previously on an Air new Zealand 747. The product on the 777 is far inferior and not worth the extra fare - the seat was cramped the same width as the economy seats whereas the 747 premium economy seats are somewhat wider. Air New Zealand should have configured the 777 premium cabin as 2-3-2 or even 2-3-3. The 17.8 inch width of this premium economy seat is 0.7 inches narrower than Air Canada's standard economy seat on the same aircraft type.\", 'We have made several journeys in the upper cabin premium economy section. Not being in the least interested in business class the premium economy is an excellent alternative. However I do find the seat padding tends to set solid after about 8hours. I now have an additional cushion that that has largely eliminated this problem. Even double long haul legs ie LHR- HKG-AKL are good value and comfortable in these seats', 'We were in seats 22 A and B (upper deck) but were fortunate enough not to have a third passenger in seat C giving us more room to spread out although I believe we would have been comfortable even with a third person. These seats are in the exit row so leg room is not an issue nor is the narrowness of the seats. I have heard complaints about the temperature but that was not a problem with the blankets provided. There really is not much of a window for this row. The side storage bin is a little awkward to reach and can disturb the passenger behind you when accessing. Our return flight LHR to LAX Ã¢\\x80\\x93 747-400 Ã¢\\x80\\x93 we had seats H and K in row 25. We found these seats to be extremely comfortable especially with no one behind us. Having the lavatory close by was not an issue most folks passing by were quiet.', 'Premium Economy Class was perfect for someone like me who has to travel between LA and AKL every month but does not want to pay the price to spread out in business class. The leg room is spacious leaving enough work space so that I can work on my lap top without disturbing the person next to me - coach seating has become so cramped on airlines that you tend to overlap each other). Plus the blankets were comfortable and there were extra pillows for my flight - it was great! Some over weight people may find the seat width a little small for premium economy (Qantas Premium Economy seems a little larger) but for a normal sized woman it is perfect.', \"LAX-PPT. You do not have many airline options flying in/out of Tahiti so Air Tahiti Nui is kind of the only way to go. That being said I am not sure who designed the seats in Moana Economy Class but I have no idea what they were thinking with the headrest. The seats are as expected in economy class - not much leg room narrow worn and used seats. I am your average 5'5 female and felt the space was adequate enough although man spreaders definitely make the space more cramped. My biggest gripe is the headrest which can move up or down but for the most part feels like someone is shoving your head forward into the most uncomfortable position in the world. There's just no way to get comfortable. For an 8 hour flight from LAX it makes sleeping difficult even if the seat is all the way reclined. The best you can do is sleep with your head tilted forward and arms crossed over your chest. Most positive comment would be the IFE which had a number of on demand movies/shows which was easy to use. Nice big crisp touch screen. Food was not the greatest but they feed you twice on each leg of the trip. FA's friendly enough; French and English.\", 'The screen was very difficult to work and hard to view. Food was quite good. The one thing I really noticed was that they did not walk down offering water as frequently as travellers need. The bathrooms were really small and I honestly wondered how heavy set people go into them.', 'We have flown quite a few airlines over the last few years and Air Transat is not bad, but its not good either. Firstly the seats, flying this airline you are going to get well acquainted with the person at the side of you. Most airlines we have flown use a 2x4x2 configuration which is ok, using a 3x3x3 means you are very cramped. We flew a different airline earlier in the day with the 2x4x2 in the same body and it was much more comfortable. I am 185 cm and I have broad shoulders and I was very uncomfortable for the transatlantic flight. The width of the isle was so narrow that I was not possible to pull my hand luggage along the floor. You will have to pay for a blanket and headphones on this airline. The in flight entertainment system is ok; full touch screen, but a limited number of movies and shows. The service was good, but it was obvious that the flight attendant was not fluent in French when making her announcements which for a dual language airline is not what you would expect. The attendants were friendly. Food was ok, but there was not enough. Flying this airline again I will make sure that I eat plenty before the flight! Overall I think it would be better to pay more for an airline with better service.', 'Calgary to Gatwick, 1st July 2015, Airbus A330. The only good point about this flight was the condition of the aircraft. However, the seats were hard, slippery, narrow and very uncomfortable.The cabin crew were rude and unhelpful, not a a hint of \"please\" or \"thank you\" at any time. The food was diabolical and very little of it. (eg. a slice of Banana Bread for a \"snack\" breakfast) The air travel side of our Canadian Holiday should have been one of the highlights, instead it turned out to be the only regret.', 'London to Calgary and back again.

The seat is wide, roomy, and exceptionally comfortable in all modes except for full flat position (solution - make it a little less flat and it is much more comfy!). Service was excellent with the friendly crew showing a flair often absent these days. Food is the same as available for economy. A unique product for a LCC, which I will be using again. My ratings are in the context of an LCC.', \"I paid extra for what Air Asia X calls a 'hot seat' with more legroom directly behind the premium economy cabin. The legroom was generous (I am 194 cm and I could stretch out) and the space in front of the seat also made access very easy. However in a crowded plane the lack of shoulder room was very uncomfortable - this airline has nine seats across in its A330 cabin where most airlines have eight. The sense of tightness was exacerbated by the arm-rests on my row of seats having to accommodate tray tables narrowing the available space further. The seats themselves are leather clad and hard; they also lack lower lumbar support. They do have adjustable head rests - a great feature. I have rated the seat overall as a '5' simply because I managed to sleep for about two hours of a seven hour plus sector. I have rated the PTV screen as 1; in fact the on-board entertainment system comes in the form of portable units which can be rented - I did not try them however.\", 'My seat row 26 had very little to no recline whatsoever and it was not an emergency row. From Honolulu to San Diego 5.5 hours was the most uncomfortable plane ride I have ever experienced. I kept falling forward when I fell asleep because the seat was so straight up.', 'Toronto to Rome and back. Same Aircraft on both flights. The aircraft appeared old it did not have the Italian colours but the tail was blue with a design I did not recognize. The seats were filthy stained and with the cover of the back coming unglued. My tray at least was unsteady and it seemed on the verge of detaching from the supporting system. The leg room was sufficient for my height and body type (I am 5\\'8\" and 170 lbs) but for anyone taller or heavier it would be extremely uncomfortable. The overhead monitor did not work and neither did the sound system. The food its not worth the comment. I think the president of this Airline should definitely consider another line of work.', 'Very narrow seat. every time a FA pass by you will be bumped. Very difficult to get in/out when the one in front is reclined (and of course it will) . The IFE screen is small and very low contrast.', 'ORD-FCO. The flight is a \"seasonal\" flight and it appears that they do not use a \"regular\" plane on it. The various seat review sites said that the \"Classica\" Cabin in the two class version had new seats with IFE. Old very old seats with no cushion left in the cushioning and no in-seat back IFE. Rather we had a CRT every 10 rows (and ours was broken). This means that the Seat arms go up all the way and no boxes to block legroom. The bad - well seat back IFE is essentially \"the standard\" now. So I am of two minds. The leg room and fully disappearing arm rests are good. The old cushionless cushions very bad. The lack of seat back IFE that is just unusual and very third world. So if you are taking a night flight the plane is not full and you do not need to be entertained this is likely better than most of the coach across the Atlantic.', 'Seat 20A. Narrow seat and has a big equipment box below the seat in front that really prevent any taller passenger to stretch his legs and try to sleep/rest.', \"Not enough leg room for somebody taller than 175 cm (5'10) specially when the passenger in front of you reclines his seat to the max. How to look at the screen is still a puzzle to me. I think you have to be under 160 cm (5'4) to have a decent view - if you are lucky the IFE works.\", 'These have to be the most uncomfortable seats I have ever had the displeasure of sitting on for three hours. Paid for more leg room which was nice but my rear end hurt so bad from the lack of padding on the seat and no ability to recline at all.

American Airlines is one of the worst. On a six hour flight from NY to SFO I was given one glass of water. They provide nothing. A beer is $7, ear plugs $5, movie $8 - soon a blanket will be $5, a pillow $5. The worst part about the flight is not the lack of the above amenities which many of their competitors provide free, but it is those things they call seats! The seats are horrible. An appalling substructure with about an inch of padding with no lumbar support. I am 6\\' tall and 190 lbs. I had the seat back reclined and the person in front of me did as well. I was reading the in flight magazine and I had 1\" from my stomach to the seat in front of me.

Out of the four suggested exercises, only two were possible with these \"new, improved seats\".', 'ORD-PHX-SNA-LAX-PHX-ORD. There is so little to redeem this airline. Check in staff rude and unprofessional, even to First Class passengers. Aircraft dirty and tired, with no entertainment. WIFI either slow or inoperative. Food in First Class has slightly improved. Seats in First Class grim, old fashioned, and barely qualify as Premium Economy comfort on quality airlines. Crews were mainly indifferent, and just going through the motions. Uniforms and airplanes grubby. What is missing from AA First Class is just that - class. A new livery is merely veneer. This airline needs a major cultural overhaul, from top to bottom. I doubt it is capable of change. At least they are buying newer aircraft. The First Class product is desperately poor. Shame on a once great national airline!', 'DFW to LHR. Last time I travel on one of those planes. AA have squashed too many seats into this plane. No space to store my overnight bag. Had to place it in business class section and was told by hostess that I could not get access to it during the flight. There is not enough legroom to sit comfortably. If the person in front of you tilts their seat back they are sitting in your lap. American Airlines have forgotten that humans traveling on long-haul flights need to be reasonably comfortable. They are slipping back into their old ways that caused the airline to fail and go bankrupt. By far the worst flight I have ever been on. Food was atrocious.', 'These seats are so tight I experienced very real claustrophobia on the red eye from LAX to ATL. I had a window seat which cramped my shoulders and the foot area was cut by about 1/3. Trying to extend my legs the top of the opening hit mid-shin blocking access to the foot area. Exiting the seat was difficult. Worst plane seat experience ever. I am 5-11 and cannot imagine the pain of someone taller. The only way to keep my knees from jamming against the seat in front was to sit as far back as possible and completely erect. On landing I slid forward and jammed both knees into the seatback hardware.', 'I was reminded why I never fly American Airlines- MCO-DFW-KON - The seats on this worn out old aircraft are crammed together so close when the person in front of you reclines you literally have strands of their hair in your face. They have tray tables but only half the size they are on all other airlines I have flown on. I could not even thumb through a magazine due to the seat in front of me being reclined into my face. The seats were worn and felt like sitting on a metal bar. In flight service is horrible for a 8 hours flight. No meal service - just overpriced snacks. One star rating is overrated.', 'I was stuck on this horrible airplane for a 5 hour flight from LAX to DCA! I had a window seat but the person next to me was a bit overweight. The side wall protruded into my seat area so I had very little space. The seat is very narrow and legroom is very minimal. It was impossible to put a drink and my laptop on the pull out table in front of me. The plane has very good storage bins above the seat an entertainment system (where almost everything costs $$) but the seats are horrible. I am a AAdvantage member but will make sure to never fly on an AA 737-800 again!!', 'They have reduced the padding in the seats and having sciatica I found these seats excruciating and could not wait to get off this plane. I will go out of my way not to fly this plane again. Though the seats were slightly wider than other economy seats the lack of padding and lack of lumbar support made this horrible for me. Legroom was fine I was in mainseat extra. for me awful product. Like riding a park bench for three hours.', 'This was my first flight with seats configured to include a desk top computer-sized metal box under each seat taking about 1/3 of the available foot/storage space. After 2 1/2 hours with my leg twisted my knee hurt quite a bit. I could not put my laptop envelop (not even a briefcase) under the seat. The seat-back storage is almost nonexistent. The seat pitch with the new contoured seats kept me from even opening my laptop that has only a 12-inch screen. My company will not pay for seats with extra legroom so I am stuck in the torture chamber. After 20 years of flying only American if it went where I was going I am looking for an alternative. American you have pushed cramming more bodies into a fixed space too far this time.', 'This is AA\\'s \"new and improved\" medium haul aircraft to replace their aging MD80 fleet and I am so appalled at the experience I really wonder what AA were thinking. The seats are on a 30\" pitch - the tightest in the AA fleet and if you are over 5\\'6\" tall you will be uncomfortable. The only upside is the IFE - every seat has a screen with some content to distract you from the cramped and uncomfortable seats - I would not recommend this aircraft for any flight over 2 hours. To add insult to injury to the frequent flyer there are only 8 first class seats giving a ration of 1 to 14 of first to economy. By comparison the outgoing MD80 had 16 first class seats giving a ratio of 1-8. So the new and improved A319 has a smaller seat pitch than the outgoing MD80 ledd first class seats (half as many) but has a TV screen in each seat. I will avoid this aircraft and actually prefer the 30 year old MD80.', \"NO legroom for anyone 6 feet or taller; I literally could not put my legs in front of me. I had to sit with a leg in the aisle and the other intruding on my wife's seat next to me. This was on a 10-hour overseas flight - almost qualified as torture. Incredibly uncomfortable when all seats are upright; when the seat in front of me was reclined I was trapped.\", 'Seat pocket is useless for storing anything bigger than a toothbrush.

I am a big guy 6\\'5\" 265lbs and these seats are not designed for tall people. Every time I fly AA I end up with Chiropractic appointments to adjust my back and neck. This past week I flew from DFW to LGA on AA and could not get the headrest high enough to support my head and neck but still fell asleep. When I awoke my neck was extremely stiff and I had a severe migraine that lasted 2 days. I simply cannot fly AA again because of the horrible seat design. I do not know who designed those seats but ergonomics was not a concern.', 'I am only 5\\'2\" but found the legroom sorely lacking. When the passenger in the seat in front of me reclined It became even tighter. My seat was in the 20th row and there was very little ability for me to recline much. Unfortunately it was the redeye flight from Los Angeles to New York and I found it impossible to sleep. I knew not to expect much attention from the stewardesses in coach. On a positive note the small TV screens on the seat back in front were a fortunate surprise. However for the price of the ticket it would be nice if they supplied a little more room in coach.', 'I am a loyal 2 million mile American loyalist. Which I believe gives me the right to complain when something is not right. My complaint is about the new economy seats with the TV screens. For starters there are three 10\"x12\"x4\" metal boxes (possibly to run the TV\\'s?) attached to the pedestals. They dramatically reduce the space for \"personal items\" and therefore increase the pressure on the precious overhead bins. In a world where the power of a 1980\\'s IBM 360 can practically be delivered in a smartphone it is \"inelegant\" at best and embarrassing at worst that these huge clunky boxes are the \"solution\" for the new seats. Also the \"back pocket\" is now just (1) a hard plastic sleeve filled with AA magazines and (2) a net pocket below that is so small and pulls out not--at-all leaving room for a couple of business cards.', 'Worse than how thin the cushions are the shape of the seat is exactly opposite of what it should be for good back posture. There needs to be lumbar support. Instead this seat is hollow in the lumbar shaped like a \"C\" and forces you to slouch. Additionally the seat cushion you sit on is ridiculously thin short and uncomfortable. The bottom line is that the ergonomics of these seats is just terrible.', 'Me and my 3 children flew from MAN-ORD on AA Flight 55. It is the same poor flight we took 5 yrs ago. It is old and no seat back movie screens. The food is terrible and the staff not very friendly.', 'DFW-OGG (Maui) round trip. Seats are small no TV or plugs just an old shared TV playing a terrible movie with terrible audio and no meal service. This was nearly an 8 hour flight and all they had were overpriced snacks for purchase. However if you were near the back of the plane the snacks ran out by the time they got to you so if you did not bring anything you starve for 8 hours. Drink service came around maybe twice but other than that the flight attendants were mostly missing in action. They might as well have just tossed the passengers in with the luggage. A truly terrible experience and I will be avoiding American Airlines like the plague from now on.', 'This was a new plane. Seat had uncomfortable metal bar where shins rest on seat in front. Seat also had a tv controller on TOP (??!) of the arm rest that made the arm rest uncomfortable. Finally back of seat curves in making bigger people hunch. Seat is not only small it is very poorly designed.', 'I am not thin and svelte any longer. However I am not a behemoth either. There was plenty of room for the seat belt to fasten but the seat was at least six inches more narrow than I am. I am bruised from the cutting of the arm on the aisle seat which does not move. The tray table would not lie flat because it was too close to my legs and stomach and my knees touched the seat in front of me (which had nothing to do with my weight) I suggest if you are a pound over 150 you do not consider this plane especially if you are on it for a long ride. (Our trip was 6.5 hours) I think the discomfort is on purpose because they will sell you an upgrade which gives you 4-6\" more legroom than the regular seats have. I had to upgrade because I became nearly claustrophobic thinking about having to climb back into that confined space. And tho the legroom helped and the fact that I was on the aisle instead of in the middle the seats were so narrow that I came off the plane with a six inch bruise from the armrest. It will be a long long time before I fly this plane again.

Now worse than 3rd rate company should have just gone bust instead of getting protected. Seats not fit for purpose food should have been condemned inflight movies unless you had a pair of binoculars screens too far away to view and content not suitable for young children. If the staff do not care about the company and their passengers and the company does not care about passenger comfort on long haul flights why are they bothering to be in business.

I figured that my flight to LA was going to be a push in the sleep department as usual so I just let it roll.', 'I recently flew AA on four flights using the 757. The seats I occupied (12 & 25) were very cramped. I was forced into a window seat even though I am disabled to some extent. It was very difficult for me to get out of the seat given my disability. The aisle seat was better but not much. The seating was deteriorated and the arm rest on the center seat in front of me was broken. The seat mount on the seat in front of me was also broken or loose as the occupant in leaned severely to the left.

I had the older seats on the DFW-LHR flight to compare them to. LHR-DFW trip the aircraft was about 2 months old but already some cabin wear was visible. Height of the IFE screen is just an inch or two lower than the preferred height mainly due to the design restrictions in the seatback. The normal IFE box found under the seats in older aircraft was gone. IFE system was fair in terms of usability and stability but not perfect. The movie selection was quite nice and the pause/play/options appeared in a natural and quick way. Picture quality was also good. They\\'ve added a \"World News\" feature in every IFE that allows full internet connectivity to worldwide news sources (free). My biggest complaint about the new IFE system would have to be the seat recline viewing angle. Whilethe seat recline is very good with the new seats I would define it as \"virtually impossible\" to watch the IFE screen in full-recline of the seat in front of you. The seat itself was average. It\\'s width is reduced compared to older seats (the new configuration is 3x4x3 compared to the previous 2x5x2 configuration) and I am unsure about the comfort of passengers. Older aircraft are said not to receive these seats until 2014 which is a disappointing fact in terms of AA\\'s quality of service.', 'The economy seats on this aircraft are ridiculously uncomfortable.

We paid for preferred seats with no one behind us but got stuck with people in front and behind due to change. I would not fly American Airlines again unless I was desperate. The crew were miserable and ready for retirement. We barely saw them too busy at the back of the plane reading and chatting! American Airlines need to get their act together. The outbound flight from LHR-DFW (B777 27A/B) was not much better and was treated like a night flight even though it was 9.30am!

After 20 hours of flying I exited my final sector feeling relaxed and comfortable. Seat pitch was great (on par with Malaysia Airlines) and seat width was also good.

Prior to this flight I flew into Bangkok with Qantas and that was the worst flight I have experienced.', \"Bangkok Airways from Hong Kong to Koh Samui. Aircraft was very new straight out of the box judging by the cleanliness. Check-in staff were very nice - offered an emergency exit seat without having to ask as I am 6ft 5.

In flight food is good although 'entertainment' could be improved upon.\", 'As I wanted to ensure that both my wife and I sat together in Club Europe part of the cabin, I was constantly checking the availability of seats. So I checked on Sat, 18th and Sunday 19th and on both occasions the only seats that were available were 2+2+1+1+1, so 7 in total. Therefore I felt that I could not wait until Tues, 21st for online check in, as I wanted to ensure that I sat next to my wife. So with that in mind I pre-booked 2 seats 15a and 15b to ensure that we sat together and the extra Ã‚Â£50. However, when I checked the seat availability again on Mon, 20th and Tues 21st, I was shocked to see that there were plenty of seats available. When I saw this I felt I had been forced and cheated by BA to pay an extra Ã‚Â£50, this left a bitter taste in my mouth and was angry with the way I had been treated by BA. The flight was delayed for 1 hour 40mins without an explanation as to why. Ok, these things happen but an explanation as to why were were delayed would have been appreciated. By the time the cabin crew came round with the supposed lunch, it was close to 3pm and by the time the cabin crew reached us, they could not offer us a choice of food and the only thing that was left, was Fish. Therefore we were left with 2 trays of front of us with a salad bowl, a bread roll, an empty cup and an empty glass and a napkin with various cutlery, totally useless if you have no food to eat. Eventually crew managed to find a Chicken dish that we could eat. The Club Europe cabin was not sectioned off to the economy class passengers. So these passengers were constantly walking past us to use the toilet facilities that were meant for Club Europe passengers. After several complaints from myself and fellow passengers did they make an announcement over the PA about the facilities. However this did not stop the constant flow of passengers', 'Seat was cramped. I am 180cm, or 5ft 9. Sat at an aisle sea; 32f. Left leg sort of lost feeling, right leg could stretch out, and that was the constant struggle I had to deal with. If the front passenger fully reclines, there goes the space which you thought you had. The seat is pretty much over the tray tables, watching a movie whilst eating was a delicate balancing act. Overall, decent but there are better airlines for long haul flights.', 'The narrowest, hardest airline seat I have ever flown in. It was an overnight flight from Philadelphia to London. I am not a big person (163cm tall, 52kg) but I had to scrunch my shoulders together to fit in the seat. I had pins and needles for 24 hours after the flight. Other people around me who were larger than me (but not \\'big\\' people by any stretch of the imagination) had to keep their arms folded for the whole flight in order to fit in the seat. Lots of people were complaining. I emailed a complaint to BA, which was met with \"sorry to hear, hope it has not deterred you from flying with us again\". A disgusting way to treat your passengers. I would rather pay more to travel with anyone than BA ever again after this experience.', \"My husband and I sat in two of the seats by the windows (which cost extra) so we had a little more room and privacy. We were in 31/B on the way to London and in 30J/K on the way back to Chicago. 31 A/B were better because there was no one behind us. The seats were fairly comfortable, but not comfortable enough for us to really sleep. The arms were really hard and could not be raised because they contained the trays. If the center one could have been raised to make more room it would have helped a lot. I could not really stretch out because of a metal box under the seat in front of me. From reviews I have read of other airlines' premium economy seats, these were good. A pillow, blanket, and eye mask were provided. I am a vegetarian and had a special meal which was all right as was my husband's meal. The flight attendants were very nice and helpful. The movies were fine too.\", 'British Airways \"Club Europe\" Business Class seat pitch now feels like a budget carrier, never mind the advertising puff. Very disappointed after 3 or 4 of these trips. Sad that British Airways had to pull this trick.', 'The 31 inch seat pitch is now so small it is like a long-haul budget airline at premium price. There is reasonable leg room provided you have nothing stashed away there or the IFE box does not get your way. Even with the tray table up, though, window seat passengers have no way of getting out to the washroom without having the other two passengers get up and out into the aisle. That makes you really popular in the middle of a long overnight flight! The back support is reasonable, but after a few hours the seat bottom starts to feel hard. Overall you feel totally cramped and hemmed in. I will never fly it again.', 'Business Class, Seat 1C in Club Europe on A320. Despite the enhancements made to the interior aesthetics of the short-haul fleet, a fare paying Club Europe passenger is bound to be left less than impressed. Since the refitting and \"upgrade\" to the new seat, the legroom is completely inadequate. It is now impossible to stretch out, work on a normal sized laptop, and in my opinion has rendered Club Europe basically a redundant product compared.', 'Premium Economy is well worth the extra money. Comfy and spacious enough to get some sleep, at least not like the economy seating. Food and beverages choices good too.', 'Hong Kong to Heathrow return. We thought it being 1 of their new A380 aircraft it would be enjoyable how wrong we were. Sat in seats 71a 71b going over 81a 81b coming back - most uncomfortable seats ever and  what is with the entertainment box being under the seat in front of you.

We have flown long haul many times and this would have to be the worst experience ever.', 'We had flown LAX to Heathrow in BA World Traveller plus seats 2x4x2 and were able to survive - but on the return in the standard Economy seats it was awful. It was inhumane! If the seat in front reclines you are trapped. The armrest will not come all the way up so a large person has an awful time getting out of their seat. I would hate to be in the middle of a row. Very bad and unhealthy seating.', \"I fleSYD-LHR return trip having recently had surgery on my left leg. Outbound I stood up for 7 hours from SYD-SIN as cabin crew decided my leg was sticking out too far and there was insufficient room to get my leg under the seat. On the return my seat offered better leg room but despite many empty seats BA allocated two large men next to me. I had to have my carry on case to keep my leg elevated which meant the two men were trapped in their seats. BA did not ask to see my Dr's letter to understand what I was going through. The staff did their very best to avoid all eye contact with passengers (presumably in case we asked for something!). My headset socket did not work but the staff just blamed the previous crew. I could write about the state of the toilets but I had rather forget what I saw. Suffice to say I drank nothing on the flight to ensure a bathroom visit was not required. My experience with BA has left me quite certain I will never book them again.\", \"Flying from London to Mauritius and back.

It soon broke again! Didn't have dinner it was 1am but breakfast was the worst I have been presented with in over 40 years of frequent flying a grey/green omelette and undercooked sausage - I did not eat it. It was an old WT+ cabin and even if they had been properly working the seats are not good. Food same as Economy drinks from plastic and paper cups. It really is a very poor product and `BA should be ashamed of it. I would not travel with BA long haul in this cabin ever again as it offers poor value for money and great discomfort. Save up to go Club if at all possible or choose another airline on the same route whose Premium Economy lives up to what it claims.\", 'Beware of seats 25A and B on the new layout in the Airbus 319. They are placed where one of the toilets used to be. There is no window and it feels cramped and claustrophobic. You are also adjacent to the door of the one remaining toilet so expect smells and long queues next to you for most of the flight.', 'I flew from Hong Kong to London. After a code share on an old Cathay Pacific plane I was looking forward to flying on one of the new A380s. I was quickly disappointed however. BA have decided to cram people in on this new plane. The legroom and general seat comfort was very poor. I only fly BA as I travel a lot with work and use BA for EU flights but I will not fly long haul with them again. It\\'s disgraceful the tiny amount of room they give while continually saying \"enjoy your flight\". It is a matter of endurance not enjoyment.', 'Just returned from London into Vancouver. Seats are not comfortable. You could get jammed into a wretched four in a row middle seat. Leg room and recline marginal. Food horrific. Service average. Scratchy blanket. TV screen kept freezing and acting up. Just economy with a little bit more leg room and given the lack of comfort not worth it. I will never book this again and will not fly British Airways again - part of it is just a feeling of the crew not caring very much. Not very pleasant either being sandwiched between business class and first class which had lovely cabins service and reclining seats. Felt like a lower class citizen with the red rope across the curtains to first class. The food was horrific. No priority boarding. Last bags to be let off in Vancouver.', \"London to Bangkok 12 hour flight. Seat in front was in full recline position for 10 of those hours.

I fear BA's hype about investment in premium economy seats is ill founded and after some 24 hours in the same seat broken by stop for refuel in Singapore I came into Heathrow sore from the seat. The service was satisfactory and when I became ill on one leg of the flight staff could not have been more helpful. But the seat discomfort was such that I would only choose BA for long haul as a last resort.\", 'Flew with my daughter from London Heathrow to Dubai on Valentines Day. This is a terrible product offered from BA. Have flown Virgin Premium Economy which knocks the socks off this BA product? Seats are incredibly uncomfortable - both recline and leg rest allow no comfortable position. There is no sense of a premium product.

It hanged at an angle which is dangerous and inconvenience when u are travelling with a child.', \"LHR-ORD-LHR I was pleased to see that the return flight was on a new 777 with larger monitors. I had a window seat 41K on BA296. However this was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on. I am 6' tall. I had absolutely no legroom with my knees pressing into the seat in front. This became even more uncomfortable once the passenger in front reclined their seat. I could not move my legs due the large entertainment system metal box on the floor immediately in front of where my right foot should rest forcing me to shift my foot far to the right. It was almost impossible to get up from my seat and get to the aisle with the seats in front reclined. I could not open my laptop on the table. I am a medical doctor. This cramped uncomfortable posture and difficulty in getting up to walk must considerably increase my risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This was more cramped than any budget airline I have been on. Having been a loyal BA customer for decades I will now never fly with BA again. Really disappointing.\", 'Dubai to LHR I have never had such uncomfortable seats bar the likes of Easyjet etc. It was a shame as it was an upgraded cabin so had new IFE etc only good thing! No seat padding they also seem to have narrower seats than the old style. But what really bugs me is that we have to use the same loos as the 200+ people behind me nothing personal but it is yucky. I could not eat either meal choice so got stitched with an economy meal. Miserable Staff as well.', 'The economy class seats at rear of B777-300 are very comfortable with good stretch of legs possible and good lumber support. I like the winglet headrest too.', 'The legroom is equivalent to a cheap charter short haul. The TV screen is ancient and poor quality . never again! Behind me was a tall man with his knees in my back who simply had no where else to put them. When I discussed it with him it was almost an air rage incident. I doubt the staff would have resolved it. He simply did not fit the seat. The flight from LHR to MIA was an hour extra sitting on the ground due to a cargo mess up.', 'The plane is new and the seat is comfortable even there is not enough legroom and in the configuration 3x3x3 the window seats are really difficult to reach. The entertainment system is great and the way the screens are built makes what you are watching not visible to the other passenger.', 'Seats 12A & 12B are the best seats in the cabin then 11J & 11K as they are bulkhead seats and you have the benefit of nobody reclining a seat in front of you both sets of seats give more legroom but 12AB give the most 12A and 11K are infant bassinet positions so these are not usually available to reserve until 24 hours before departure unless you are travelling with an infant. The AB side of the aircraft are served first for everything so you have a better chance of getting the meal of your choice on that side of the aircraft rather than the JK side. All seats are much much better than normal economy and definitely worth paying the extra for the premium ecnomy (world travelller plus as BA call it) especially if you can get seats in the pairs of AB/JK rather than the 4 in the middle. Window seats can be difficult to get out of when the person next to you in the aisle seat is in a reclined position and asleep.', '31C very cramped the seats feel smaller than other aircraft in the fleet in Economy. Once I had put my books and newspaper in the pocket in the seat in front my knees were right up against it. The table is very small. The biggest gripe I would have is legroom this is severely hampered by the In Flight entertainment box being placed under the seat in front.', 'As I am now retired I fly long haul at least three trips a year. I also upgrade to premium economy as at 6foot 2 inches the seat pitch of 31 inches is crippling. On 1/10/2014 I flew BA 274 from Las Vegas to LHR BA premium economy the aircraft was old and tired and although the pitch was adequate I was budged up beside my next door passenger. Needless to say I will not be flying BA again as I object to paying thousands for business. Why do the various Far East Airlines give so much more for your money.', 'We were in WT+ seats 23 A and B from LHR to SEA. On this 777-300 we had the \"new\" World Traveler Plus seats. The seats are a step up from the shabby WT+ seats on the 747-400 we had on our outbound flight. The seats were \"slimline\" with very little seat padding and poor lumbar support. Probably the best feature of the new WT+ seat is the larger AVOD monitor built into the back of the seat in front. The new AVOD system is far superior especially the moving map function. There is a foot rest that drops down from the seat in front; it is nice but does not add much to the experience. Lavs (just two of them one on each aisle) are located just aft of the WT+ cabin and are shared with the main WT cabin; otherwise you have to hike back to the very rear to make use of the lavs there. Like other BA long-haul aircraft the 777-300 does not have passenger air vents above the seats in WT or WT+. Because the cabin temperature is kept at near-sauna levels the lack of vents can make the trip very very uncomfortable. Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is that leg-room is restricted by two metal equipment boxes under the seats in front. The boxes restricted the ability to stretch legs and effectively prevented storing any carry-ons under the seat in front. While the new WT+ has its short-comings it is still far superior to anything offered by US carriers as a premium economy product. For us the positives were worth the cost belong regular WT and in any event the cost of WT+ was far less than what we would have paid for Club World.', 'We flew SEA-LHR on an aging 747-400 in World Traveler Plus seats 29 J and K near the 3R door. BA boards WT+ dead last. The seats were the old WT+ and showed their age in all respects (worn dirty etc); the AVOD monitor for seat 29J was so badly scratched and smeared that it was difficult to watch anything. The cabin was unbearably warm; be aware that BA\\'s long-haul fleet evidently do not have seat air vents - so no way to keep cool. Seat 29K has no seat in front of it which makes leg room excellent and also allows for easy access to and from the seat to the aisle and area around the exit door. Seat width is poor and the seat has function buttons (and AVOD controls) on the inside of the arm rest making access and use very difficult. While it is true that the cost of WT+ is far less than the cost of Club World there is a big difference in seat comfort and the ability to get any real rest/sleep. On the other hand WT+ is far superior to what US airlines offer as their premium economy product (e.g. Delta \"economy comfort\" on its 767-300 on the same SEA to LHR route).', 'This had to be the most uncomfortable flight in the world we flew American airlines LHR-MIA 777-300er and the seats were comfy and the flight entertainment worked. On the way back we flew BA from MIA-LHR and it was really bad I do not recommend sitting in row 33-36 as the leg room is reduced and the seats are uncomfortable I had a headphone set that did not work and a box under the seat in front of me so I did not have any leg room for my left foot now me being 6ft something and as a 15 year old teenager who likes a bit of leg room found it difficult to find some. I had flown from PLS-MIA before that flight to LHR but could not get any sleep because of the most uncomfortable chairs. I am willing to give BA another go but I might go premium economy or even club world. Not a good flight at all do not sit in seat 35G!', 'I am a seasoned business traveller and on long haul flights I tend to use Premium economy if available. Usually the extra cost is about Ã‚Â£500 and I try to use points and money to further upgrade but that is usually a lottery and not often successful. I followed a similar procedure with a BA flight form LHR to JNB on an A380 and was in premium economy on the upper deck at the front bulkhead so leg room was not a problem but the seat itself was very disappointing compared to other BA flights I have been on in essence it was a an economy seat with more leg room and a worse than useless leg rest which did not come up far enough to support your legs comfortably. In addition BA are missing a trick as these 7 bulkhead seats could have a small food rest attached to the bulkhead so you could stretch your legs out completely. A further premium could be charged I am sure not dissimilar to the practise of many airlines. In future on this route I will save my money and fly economy as I did not see a Ã‚Â£500 premium in the seat Ã‚Â£300 tops. (I have just had a look at the BA web site and the same return flights as mine for next week has an Ã‚Â£1800 premium utter madness)', \"We had a miserable experience flying directly from Phoenix to Heathrow and back. The seating was much more cramped than in the past with little leg room nowhere to rest elbows and inevitable physical contact with the person next to you.

Homebound in daylight much neater. Pricey. Can't see me sitting in economy for ten hours over eleven hours back. Wedged in. Leg room is worth it.\", \"The seats in economy are nothing but horrible. In theory they may be ok but that is only on paper. You feel cramped with little legroom and the backrest has a hard area that sticks out and makes it difficult to lean properly back.

I have traveled coach and business previously. It is an improvement on coach in terms of legroom and seat comfort the cabin service is more personal and although the food and drink is the same it is served with cloth serviettes and steel cutlery. (How do they get steel knives through security?) The main benefit though is that there were lots of empty seats while coach on this flight from CPT to LHR was full. The biggest let-down is the tiny low-res TV screen. One factor in favour of coach is that the hand-rests fold back so that if you are lucky enough to be the sole passenger in a row of 3 or 4 you can lie across the seats and enjoy a business class standard lie-flat bed.

I will definitely upgrade from now on if the price is reasonable. I was fortunate to have the aisle seat on the 4 seat center row and the seat beside me was empty! There was so much more leg room that I was comfortably able to stretch me bad knee out. The seat felt a bit wider too. I believe the food was the same that is served in Economy which on BA is pretty tasty. The only difference was that they came around with a basket of warm rolls tastier than the freezing cold ones you usually get. At the beginning of the flight they gave out warm damp hand towels very refreshing. Only problem was the couple in front of me reclined their seats all the way back the minute that they sat down. The person's head was basically in my lap. Unbelievable rude. I had to ask the flight attendant to request that they raise their seat during meal service or I would not have been able to eat. I wish the airlines would not have seats that recline into the lap of the passenger behind them a little recline is okay but too far just does not work.\", 'The seats that I had on the outward and return journey from London Heathrow to the Gulf were comfortable with good head support and good back support when the cushion was used. The audio/visual screen was OK and I found it easy to get some sleep.

I was allocated a middle seat and could not change it when I checked in very early.

It was with the greatest difficulty that I was able to get out of the seat to reach the aisle particularly when the seat in front was reclined in fact almost impossible. The TV screen is very small and in my case fell out of it is housing and despite efforts by the crew to hold it in place with sticky tape they were not successful. The food was good and better than ordinary economy. But I did not consider the extra money for the premium class seat well spent for a single traveller. It would be better for a party of two who could choose the seats at the side.', \"Seat: 33H (LHR-SIN). Right side of the plane first row in economy which is an aisle seat at the bulkhead so you have room to stretch out but creeps into the aisle. The width of these seats I found a problem the rest are wider which are not bulkhead. I wanted an exit seat but there are not any on the BA 747's. It was a cheap flight so was not too fussed. Headrests are great BUT they slide down a lot. The seats also have a lot of flex if someone behind leans on yours to get of the seat. TV's are good size but could be bigger.\", 'I guess BA are not upgrading WT+ as they retire the 747 fleet.

With my reservation despite entering Economy as cabin choice it defaulted to World Traveller Plus for more or less the same way. But as other travelers have noted this is NOT worth the extra money. And as for the crew - as tired and worn as the seats.', 'JFK-LHR-JFK. Worst legroom I have ever experienced - never been an issue before in 20 years of flying with BA. Paid $75 per seat to have exit aisle seat on return flight. Cabin service was very good.', 'Horrible experience on a long haul flight almost claustrophobic.

Outbound flight my wife and I were stuck with two seats on the left of a four seater in the middle of Economy - not great and leg room was poor (especially when seat in front reclined). On return sector selected two seats together during online check-in at the rear of Economy where the aircraft narrows - meaning the configuration switches from 3x4x3 to 2x4x2. Much more legroom and plenty of storage space - plus decent accessibility. Generally the seats on the BA 747s are reasonably comfortable and have a clever adjustable headrest which provides good neck support. The seats are not the new slim-line versions used by other carriers and so have decent padding. Definitely adequate for a 7 hour flight - but am sure on long flights to HKG SIN SYD or NRT discomfort could become an issue. Both B747s we traveled on must have been over 15 years old but in good shape - clean cabin and toilets etc. No issues with food and service was good (although an observation - BA do not tend to station cabin crew in the Economy cabin during boarding to assist passengers with luggage / finding seats etc - unlike Middle-Eastern / Asian carriers). Only real issues were overcrowding at BA's Terminal 7 as JFK and the IFE screen very small. BA charge a extortionate amount to pre-book seats prior to online check in opening. Best advice is to just complete online check-in early to ensure best seat selection.\", 'Clean aircraft, friendly personal, decent service. It was way better than I first expected.

WTP is a big improvement over standard economy but the bigger seat is all you get. The rest of the service is the same as World Traveller. You even have to use the WT toilets.

The economy cabin on the plane was a comfortable 2x4x2. The seats were very comfy and reclined far enough to sleep. The legroom was very good as I am quite short. The entertainment is the best I have experienced, a good range of movies etc. The only downside was before every movie there were about 2 minutes of ads (although you can skip through them).

I love that Cathay is now using more of the newer seats on these regional routes.', 'HKG-SYD-HKG in Premium Economy and its a good product. Seats are comfortable, good width, storage space and the seat pitch is great. CX always has/had a good entertainment program, downside, the monitors are not as good as other carriers and the audio is a bit weak. Food and drinks are good and have a nice choice. I like that Premium Economy is in a separate compartment which makes the cabin much more relaxed and not so much \"toilet traffic\" (very good in particular on night flights). Overall a good product although the price difference between Economy and Premium Economy at CX is quite considerable and not quite in line with the offering.', 'Cathay Pacific have the best all round Premium Economy seat for the 8 hours from Australia. They offer the only Premium Economy seat direct from Brisbane to Hong Kong with 2 flights a day (day one stops in Cairns for an hour which is no deal breaker). Being a large guy these seat are really comfortable, armrests on aisle seats can be lifted, enough recline to sleep but not too much to trap you in. Food and service is good, not quite as good as Qantas, but more comfortable seats. Only drawback is there is no seperate toilets, you use the economy ones. Again, not a big thing and there is never really a big line up. Seats have good screens, plenty of movie choices, lots of storage in front of you, with USB charging at screen level. Keep it up Cathay', 'Worst seats ever on a long distance flight! My flight Zurich to Hong Kong was perfectly ok as the seats were reclinable. But on the return flight the seats were non reclinable (shell seat) and a 12 hours night flight in one of these is pure torture. Never had I ever travelled in such seats and never will I ever reiterate this experience. Ergonomics is absolutely not considered and despite of my small size which make most of my long distance flight seems pretty confortable in comparison to taller people these seats kept me from sleeping and my back still has not recover two days later. Only positive aspects of my flights were the helpful staff nice food and good entertainment.', 'Kaoshuing to Hong Kong. The seats were really great. Studio CX was fantastic it provides plenty of movies and music. Games like Inflight Golf Tournaments are also available. The seat was comfortable with good legroom for you to move your legs. The seats will be a bit too small for those who are fat access of seats are also the same; but for me it was wonderful.', \"Boeing 777-300 with hard shell seats. Hard shells was not that bad after all on a short haul 4 hour flight. Although seats do not recline and the person at the front will not lean back and occupy your limited space hard shells are not comfortable when compared to other ordinary seats and I do not feel relaxed at all. These seats should not appear on an aircraft of a 5-star airline. If Cathay wants seats that do not recline so much and occupy one's place at the back maybe they could choose ordinary seats that could recline but with a max angle fixed so as to reduce effects on the person at the back.. On the other hand seat legroom was just acceptable not satisfactory enough and seat width was good just like other Cathay aircraft. Conclusion: Fixed shell seats not preferred.\", 'Flew HK to LHR after flying from ADL to HK with only one hour to stretch our legs between flights. I concede this may have made the second leg more difficult than it might otherwise have been but I will never again go all the way from Australia to Europe (or back) without at least one night in a hotel.

The seats did not recline and I had to sit upright for the whole flight. I have a bad back and the result was agony and crippling. The return flight was so painful I thought I was going to pass out and that was after 2 hours! There was no room to stretch and the seat provided so little wriggle room. I tried exercises and everything to make myself comfortable. The cabin staff were wonderful and the food was great. Entertainment was very good but those seats were terrible.', 'Whoever decided to do away with a reclining seat and replace it with a shell seat where the back and squab slump you forward needs to be brought to task. Never have I experienced such a dismal failure in design - almost everything about this abomination is an insult to what would be considered good customer care. Honestly a park bench would have been more comfortable. I will never fly with Cathay on any aeroplane that has this type of seat fitted again.', 'The hard shell seats are terrible it does not recline it slides down instead though you will get more privacy with it but it is not worth it. Meal is great though! Crew members work hard appreciate to it.', \"Flew Hong Kong to Paris. The shell seating in Economy is inhuman. They do not recline. It is impossible to sleep and we ended up with neck pain for days after. Legroom is very limited resulting in swollen ankles.

Flight attendants work smart with quick react.', \"From Sydney via Hong Kong to Paris. First 10 hours to HK were okay pretty on par with other major airlines and no complaints about the A300 seat comfort access or configuration. However the A340 shell seats are hard uncomfortable and the worst I have sat on. The fact that the seat does not recline from your hips and merely slumps you downwards putting an immense amount of pressure on your lower back and bottom is terrible for getting any kind of sleep rest or even just general comfort. I am average height and small build but I can only imagine with horror what this might feel like for taller or bigger built people. When slumped in the seat there then appears a large gap between the paper thin seat padding and the headrest causing further spinal issues with no support for your head neck and shoulders. As a final insult the seat belts have an airbag in them which makes one side of the belt extremely bulky quite weighty and cumbersome so that even just sitting upright never mind trying to sleep is uncomfortably restricted by this bulging leather strap. There's also limited leg room under the seat in front not sure why but it is probably the fault of the shell seat design being so low to the floor and there is also very limited space in the seat pocket annoying when you cannot fit much under the seat either. The only saving grace this aircraft design has is the configuration. I was travelling with just one other person and it was nice to just sit in a twosome without fear of the dreaded middle seat or clambering over a stranger while they sleep to go to the restroom.\", 'Flew Paris to Hong Kong in a shell seat that does not recline. Impossible to sleep and my TV did not work. Do not fly in this aircraft on Cathay until you can be sure that they have replaced these appalling seats with ones that recline.

I had a great experience with CX. I have flown on Cathay's economy and PE is much better. The seat is very new and has very generous width and pitch. The service however is not much better than economy. You get priority services at the airport but not much more on the plane. The food is pretty much the same except for metal cutlery. You get a small basic amenity kit.

I had two flight legs with CX - one of two hours and another of twelve hours. The seats have a feature best described as \"slouching\" whereby the bottom cushion that you sit on slides forward enforcing a type of involuntary slouch in the seat. There is no back support and any flight time of longer than say two hours this is absolute torture. Sleep is near impossible as in addition to this the seats are extremely hard.', 'This is the \"new economy\" seat that have replaced the fixed back \"shell\" seats. The seat has good pitch very good width and storage with the cubbin on the seatback plus three pouches below the literature pocket- all very useful for a long flight. The AVOD system is great but only needs more and better choices of programs and games. Two major problems with these new seats - the base seat cushion becomes hard quickly and the recline intrudes greatly on personal space and privacy. At two hours (on a 15 hour flight) the seat became noticeably uncomfortable. My legs became numb from pinched circulation at about 3 hours. The new 6 inches recline is nice when you are sitting in it but intrudes greatly into the space behind you. The unpredictability of a 2 to 6 inch recline creates stress. Your knees get banged laptop knocked off the tray table etc. And your personal space and privacy is mostly in control of the whim of the passenger in front of you. Also the thinner and lighter seat material makes for a smaller seat footprint which amplifies the loss of privacy when the person in front or to your side reclines. When the adjacent seat reclines if you are to the right you get an almost full view of their TV screen. That can be a distraction to you as their screen flashes when you want to read or sleep.', 'I am a large man and it was agony flying from Los Angeles to Bangkok. No power plug for the laptop. Seat rows too close to use the laptop as the space was too small to unfold it. Seats were fine for small framed people But for large people it made for a very long trip.

It has more recline a more comfortable seat and a better touchscreen entertainment system.', 'The designer of the seat knows nothing about ergonomics. The back does not incline but the seat pad slides forward instead without any support at the waist. Back cushion is so thin that I felt laying on a piece of steel. Head rest makes my neck painful. Simply a nightmare and as such I will not take CX again.', 'In the viewing position seating is comfortable as there is a natural recline and you get decent support. Cushions seem standard. You have good view of the screen with good inflight entertainment. In the sleeping position however it is torture. The back support could not be adjusted the bottom seat slides forwards a few inches instead. There is not a great sleeping position. You just get neck problems whilst sleeping and need to support your neck whist waking up. For long haul flights and for sleep these are absolutely the worst seats.', \"This was one of the older Boeing 747-400s in the China Airlines Fleet so therefore there was a lack of entertainment in Economy Class (only an inflight magazine was provided even on a long flight like ours which was from Vancouver to Taipei). Some of the facilities (restrooms etc.) were also slightly older-looking. However I understand that China Airlines does have some newer 747s with personal televisions at every seat as well as nicer seats (I've been on one of these as well) and these are much more suitable for long-haul flights.\", 'These seats are well-designed and are very suitable for long-haul flights like the one I took from Taipei-Vancouver. The seat had a personal television as well as a massaging footrest. Though I am small in size I still found getting out into the aisle a bit difficult.', \"CX's new economy class seats are a quantum leap from the last generation of fixed shells. The seats are thin enough to give good knee/leg room without compromising lumbar support. At least as comfy as the SQ econ seats. Seat feels solid and well built. New IFE uses a touchscreen - personally found it a bit slow rather temperamental. Have to wonder how these will hold up after several months of abuse by kids etc. Small recess under the IFE screen for storing phones cameras wallets glasses etc a nice touch. Thumbs up to CX for carving slits into this recess so you can easily see if you have left any valuables as you deplane.\", 'The seats on both these flights from Perth to London were the most uncomfortable we have ever travelled in.', 'On the upright position you get decent support even though the cushion is a bit thin and hard compared to standard airlines seats. In the recline position however you get pretty much no back support as you end up sliding down (below the head rest) to get into any type of position conducive to sleep. For flights under 5 hours I would choose these seats over standard reclining seats. You have good view of the screen there is a power outlet and you can enjoy the inflight entertainment. Where Cathay made the mistake is for long haul flights where people are inclined to sleep for some portion of the flight. For sleep these are absolutely the worst seats. I think they made a mistake in installing them on their trans-continental flights. In an ironic note if you do not want to sleep on your flight these seats are the best. If you want to sleep choose a different airline. If you want to stay awake the whole time (which for flights arriving at night in either direction helps with the jetlag) I would choose Cathay.', 'China Airlines A330 configuration means that in the front Economy cabin AB seats have a wider seat pitch than the other seats as there is one less row of seats on the AB side.', 'These seats would have to be worst ever. The physical seat shell did not recline however the seating within the shell slid to make believe you \"reclined\". After being loaded on the plane and being told that we had to wait for 10 mins for connecting passengers to join our flight after sitting for this period the seats then became extremely uncomfortable. Butt and back padding is very slim and had to travel our whole return trip from Rome via Hong Kong to Sydney with the pillow and blanket at my lower back. this made the seat just bearable however frequent moving and getting up standing for multiple periods of time made the trip just manageable. The only benefit of this type of chair is that you do not have the chair in front of you recline in your face - but this would have been great if the padding on the chair was softer.', 'BNE to HKG and onto PVG. Awful seats. Have one more flight next week from PVG to BKK and thats it. No more Cathay Pacific for me. The shell seats are uncomfortable for a 183 cm tall person. Okay for 2 hours maximum but from BNE to HKG they were torture.', \"The seats are ok for short flights but very hard on long flights. There is no 'recline' available it just slides forward and pretends to recline. Leg room is marginally better than other economy seats since the back of the seat in front does not recline which is the only plus for this type of seat. Bring something to sit on as the seats get very hard after the first 6 hours!\", 'Very bad design not enough upholstery behind your back or under your bottom. Impossible to sleep because the seat did not recline. I was cold the seat was hard I could not sleep.', 'The new seat design is really horrible. The seat no longer reclines and it becomes very uncomfortable for a long haul flight. I could not sleep well.', 'I flown many airlines and this was the first that caused my ankles to swell. If you suffer from DVT stay away and if you are over 5 foot you should also stay away. I will never travel with them again - awful.', 'Seats are agonisingly painful after a few hours. There is a critical fault which means that there is not enough padding - a metal bar across the bottom of the seat hurts the bottom of your spine - the worst economy seat in the air.', 'The old Cathay Pacific seats was a lot more comfortable than the new seat which does not recline. I always like Cathay Pacific but with the new seat I would recommend to fly another carrier even if it is not a direct flight.', 'The most useless seats - these seats define the very bottom of what I have ever experienced. Stay away if you can. Cabin staff and food were great and the only reminder of a 5 star airline.', 'I had exit row aisles on my journey because I am tall but they were very problematic as it was next to toilet and there was not enough room for people waiting to stand so they stood on my feet all night. This miserable airline had squeezed so many seats into the plane that there was no space even around the exit area - if there was an emergency it would be chaos! The next problem was the fact that Cathay economy seats do not recline so I had the trip from hell being over 6 foot as my head kept falling forward despite a support pillow. On this airline they think that by having the bottom of the seat slide forward you have comfort - wrong. I had no sleep in 24 hours.', 'There was no recline. Seat pad moved forward slightly which brought my knees up against the seat in front Because of design of seat there was no head support and pillow supplied did not fill the gap between back of my head and seat. The airbag attached to the seatbelt caused problems when the passenger in the adjoining seat moved they pushed down on the armrest which forced the airbag down into my thigh. The armrests were about 5cms too low and as a result did not offer any support.', 'ICN-PVG-LHR and CDG-PVG-ICN. I sat near lavatory and it make some sounds like crash when people after use lavatory.

The airline batted 100 percent in three categories: None of the flights were on time. All of the food was pretty bad (even for airplane food standards) and all the in-flight entertainment was outdated or physically unviewable. We did have one recent American film shown and it was great-- but it was a 1.5 hour flight so they cut it off before the ending. They are quick to warn you regarding turbulence and the flight attendants are plentiful and responsive. Best meal was the Chinese breakfast of yogurt fruit and pork and chicken dumplings. Drinks are frequently served but beer/wine if at all available runs out quickly (but it is free in economy). No hard alcohol in economy.\", 'London to Sydney via Hong Kong. The journey entailed four flights in two different plane types. The return flight was direct with a 2 hour changeover in Hong Kong. I can only agree with the majority of passengers on this site who have already reviewed the new seats. They are actually appalling - the worst I have ever experienced. They do not recline and for myself and my husband that made sleep impossible. Whenever we tried to fall asleep our heads would loll forward the breathing became restricted and we immediately woke up. The slide forward motion of the horizontal seat only succeeded in creating a non-supported gap behind the lower back which was very uncomfortable.', \"Cathay Pacific's new Economy class seat was average even though it was quite well designed. I had an aisle seat and found no trouble at all. The negative about the seat was that you could not recline. The food was great like the service and fares.\", 'No PTV or AVOD very poor. All we could do is watch main screen clips and listen to poor music.', 'It is clear that the people at CX responsible for selecting these seats have never flown long haul in them. We flew Toronto-Hong Kong and Hong Kong-Sydney return. The trip was a miserable experience. The seats are narrow no legroom to speak of no real recline and the \"air bag\" built into the seat belt further reduces comfort. My advice is fly with a different airline.', 'The legroom was small. The woman sitting next to us was so close we could feel her breathing on us. The seats did not recline which made the trip unbearable. The air conditioning was freezing in our cabin. The food was good and the service was quick.', 'The idiots who signed off on these Economy seats should be made to spend the rest of their lives suffering in them themselves. Totally uncomfortable and not permitting any chance of a sleeping position of any kind. I had a free seat next to me and it did not provide any relief. How did they even get to deciding this is what an Economy Class passenger might find reasonable.', \"I had heard rave reviews about Cathay Pacific but was aware of the new seating they had installed in Economy Class so I knew what to expect. I was travelling with them as part of a package to the Hong Kong Sevens so did not have any other alternative. The seats confirmed my worst fears. They are just awful. I am 6ft 5 and if you choose your seat carefully on line before getting to the airport then you can at least get some leg-room if you are lucky. The real issue is comfort. There simply is not any as the seat cusion is just too thin. The 'recline' or slide forward motion is awful as well. I had a really sore lumbar on arriving back in London as you cannot get comfortable and sleep is nearly impossible in an upright position. Warning! Take a seat and neck cushion. It's hard to believe that this refurbishment was (I hope) researched and tested prior to introduction. If it had surely it would not have progressed.\", 'The shell seats offer a personal space in which nobody can intrude. There is good lumbar support if you keep your backside close to the cushion and do not slide. If you do slouch then a cushion is necessary to fill the gap. The shell is actually more reclined than regular airline seats.', \"I flew return from Vancouver to Delhi via Hong Kong in February. Although there were two different aircraft involved each with a different seat configuration the seats were the same - the worst I have ever experienced. Very little legroom but worst of all the seats did not recline. All that could be done was to slide the seat bottom forward which only gave the illusion of leaning back a bit. This put my back into a painful slumped position and because the seat back was still upright my head and neck were pushed forward. Within half an hour I had excruciating back pain which I could not get rid of regardless of how I positioned myself. On such a long flight as Vancouver - Hong Kong such seats seem absurd since it is pretty much impossible to sleep. I was miserable the entire time and could only pray that the seats between Hong Kong and Delhi would be different. They weren't. When the agonising trip was finally over and I was finally in India I kept having the awful realisation that I was going to have to sit in the same torturous seats all the way home again.\", 'I am on the tall side (6\\' 2\") and skinny and found the shell seats some of the worst airline seats I have ever sat in. The issue is the way they recline since the seat slides forward the headrest never allows your head\\'s center of gravity to get behind your solders. This makes it very hard to sleep because your head keeps flopping forward. The other issue with the recline on these seats is that the seat base slides forward making it very hard to extend your legs out under the seat in-front of you. The overall result is a truly uncomfortable slouch.', 'We paid $100 extra for each flight to have \"Extended Legroom Seats\". Unfortunately this put us in Row 31 beside an exit door. The cold and the noise from the door were both unbearable throughout the trip. Cathay Pacific should not charge a premium for these seats despite the extra legroom. Our written complaint to the airline generated a reply but not a very satisfactory adjustment ($50 voucher for duty free on our next flight).', 'Los Angeles to Hong Kong. The seat is very good overall. The seat backs are fixed so that the person in front of you does not recline into your face. The recline and tray latch proved to be a little difficult. The personal TV screen was located at a comfortable level with the controller below.', 'I found the economy seat so uncomfortable that that after my return leg journey is completed I will never fly CX economy again. I cannot believe that the seat designers and management of CX actually tested these seats. Yes the passenger in front does not recline into your \"space\" but the downside is a terrible seat position - most uncomfortable non ergonomic position I have encountered on an aircraft.', 'Flew SYD-HKG and HKG-LHR on these seats. These \"mini-shell\" seats are just horrible. While the legroom is good and the seat width is average I spent 13 hours of suffering on the Hong Kong- London route due to a small hard cushion a firm backrest no neck support and almost no head support due to the awkward recline. Tried to sleep but could not and on both flights ended up with sore butt and neck/head ache as well. Just weak. Have two more flights with these seats both overnight and are dreading them both. Will not ever fly economy with CX again with these seats and I will not ever fly economy to London again as I barely survived the Economy crush.', 'The shell economy seats are terrible!! Cathay promote their shell seat as being better than previous as it does not recline into the seat behind. However it is not easy - almost impossible - for someone to sleep sitting bolt upright. The seat cushion - which is very slim - only slides down about 4\" within the shell and this is the extent of the movement in the seat. I was not a happy traveller !', 'Having read these reviews I can only assume the \\'shell\\' seat is unbearable at any height. I am a 5\\'6\"female & travelled with my 15yo son (5\\'10\") and husband (5\\'9\") - all of slim to average build - from Melbourne to Hong Kong. This was our first experience of these seats and the torture they induce. We each tried to cope with the unnatural shapes the seat contorts your body into by adopting different positions - enduring neck back and/or tailbone pain as a result. These seats are unquestionably the worst we have ever experienced I am just glad we left our 6\\' plus son behind. We assumed this was an old plane/old design; having just visited the Cathay site I am shocked to learn they are being lauded particularly given all the negative reviews.', 'For an economy seat leg room was good even with the seat recline.

The back of the seat provides no lumbar support and is hard. I will happily put up with this given the huge improvement brought about by the seat sliding forward into a recline rather than by tipping the seat back into the lap of the guy behind. This must lower passenger tension and air-rage and is surely worth it.

Without this act of kindness I would have been crippled because the new shell design (non-reclining) is completely insane.

One can only hope that these things get scrapped and a legitimate engineer designs the new ones. Cathay Pacific dropped the ball on this one and I cannot understand how it has not affected their rating.', 'I have been flying with Cathay for the past 15 years.

It has very thin padding and provides no support.', 'Seats were good and provide sufficient legroom and width.', 'Comfortable seat good size PTV screen.

On one leg of the flight there were empty seats next to me but I could not use them to recline because the armrests only fold up partially. One can only hope that the airline quickly realizes what a big mistake they made with these seats and replaces them soon! I am certainly not going to fly this airline again until they do so.', 'My seat was 30A this is the best seat in the new A330 on flights from Australia to Hong Kong. This seat is the first row of the economy cabin although this cost around AUD$100 (HK$700) extra but worth it on those 10hr long haul flights.

The seat back was very thin even for an economy class seat so I felt every movement that the back passengers made and it was even worse because I had to travel with noisy children at my back so it was a constant kicking at my back. The plane had no IFE except for the overhead TV's and a couple of music channels - okay for a short haul flight but not for this kind of flight. Some seats did not have pillows blankets the airline magazine or even the safety chart. The only decent thing was the legroom so I could stretch my legs well to compensate the lack of seat recline.

There was no division between the cabins and the space between my Economy seat and the Premium Economy seat in front was the standard space between two Economy rows. But the Premium Economy seat reclined an extra 30%. The passenger in front of me chose to exercise the full recline despite my vocal objections which resulted in a horribly cramped and unbearably uncomfortable flight. The crew were not really interested in my problem. Add to that a plane that needed cleaning properly (really how did the cleaning staff miss a large used paper cup in my seat pocket?) the life jacket under my seat was dangling down on the floor food quality was below average and you can understand why it will be a long time before I set foot on another El Al flight.', 'Seats were crowded and minimal legroom. leg room wa minimal.

On my return journey , when I boarded the plane at KL the young woman in front of me had already fully reclined her seat and it was quite difficult to squeeze into mine. When preparing for take off the stewardess did not even notice the reclining seat. They really do not check properly. As far as I am concerned when the person in front of you fully reclines their seat they are invading the space of the person sat behind. Because of this I had a very uncomfortable 12 hour journey to Dubai.', 'The aircraft was clean and tidy - inflight entertainment was very good, seating with 3x4x3 layout.

Very very disappointed. Squeezed in like sardines on both aircraft making the seats very narrow and ultimately uncomfortable. Travelled on 777-300 numerous times on long haul with a 3x3x3 configuration which was very good - Emirates 3x4x3 is a joke. Again huge letdown with the A380 seating arrangement. Priority seems to be numbers and not passenger comfort with Emirates - just do not get all the hype. Entertainment was great but I would far rather have seat comfort and a bit of room to move around in and an 'average' entertainment system than the other way around.

I interacted with around 20 flight attendants during these 4 legs and 18 were great it is funny how 2 from 20 will stick out more in my mind.

On the first leg the cabin crew appeared thoroughly disinterested. When eventually the meal reached Row 76 it was luke warm. The drinks trolley arrived as we were finishing the meal and tea and coffee was not offered. Landing at DXB was delayed for over one hour by a duststorm that we understood had been raging for several days. We boarded the B777 for DXB-DAR on time only to sit on the stand for some two hours whilst other flights were given greater priority to take off in the limited visibility caused by the duststorm. To be fair the flight and service on this leg was quite reasonable once airborne. However we arrived at DAR so late that we had missed our onward flight to ZNZ and had to pay for a replacement and to add to the stress Emirates had opted to leave one of our bags either at LHR or DXB. The return from DAR-DBX was good but the having boarded the A380 at DBX very efficiently the departure from the stand on the DXB-LHR was delayed for an hour due to a medical emergency (obviously not Emirates fault). Once airborne it was again evident that the cabin crew simply cannot cope with the number of passengers a fully loaded A380 and once again service did not match expectations. From past experience Emirates has always warranted its 4 star rating but standards have clearly slipped in recent time and that is no longer the case. We will need to find an alternative airline for our next trip to DAR/ZNZ', \"This was the most comfortable long haul flight I have ever taken. Oslo to Dubai.

I could not watch the seat back monitor as it was too close and getting out from my seat was difficult due to the seat in front of me being reclined. I have had many long haul flights but I would have to say this was the worst and most memorable.\", 'Very hard firm straight back seat with headrest positioned about shoulder blades and would not shift. No lumbar support simply awful. Like sitting on a wooden backed dining chair with minimal padding. Fortunately only in it for 3.5 hours would not have wanted to do long haul e.g. Brisbane/Dubai in it. Suffering made longer by plane having wrong waypoints laid in and spending a lot of the flight heading towards Sydney not Brisbane.', 'We returned home 3 days ago flying from Venice to Dubai in 777. My husband is tall so we had asked for exit seats After arriving at the airport early (at 5.30 am in the hope of getting an exit seat) for a 10.10am flight. We were told sorry but all exit seats had already been reserved for Melbourne travellers (we are from NZ). The flight to Dubai was an horrendous 6 hours the seats were so close and five minutes into the flight while we were still climbing the woman and man in front of us put their seats back! It was a hell ride one we wont be repeating.', 'Sydney-Dubai-Sydney. Staff attentive and polite. WiFi you get 10MB free and pay $1US for an additional 10MB. It took me some time to connect but once I did was all good. Food quality is very good unfortunately not much variety. Entertainment was great - the earphones were not good and were quickly replaced.', 'I suppose it comes down to the route you are flying. But to my knowledge many aircraft are very old and not comfortable. When you fly the new Boeing 787 in economy, seats are a touch hard but still comfortable. Recline is fine and leg space is larger then many other airlines I have traveled with. Personal tv in the seat infront of you is an extra on these new airplanes. All my coments on the B787 are valid for their Boeing 777-200, same comfort.', 'Seat was comfortable but the legroom was nearly not available. The space between the seats for the legs was so short that it was nearly impossible to access the seat. Even if I am not a really big person I had to put my legs on both sides of the seat in front of me. Legroom on Ryanair is better then Ethiopian Airlines long haul.', 'Emirates have tried to squeeze the last drop out of the orange in their economy seats and seating plan in their B777. The 3x4x3 configuration is too tight for this aircraft and makes the aisle just wide enough for the food cart. If in any aisle seat you will be hit every time they come past. The seat width and legroom is fine if you are an 8 year old child but for someone who is 6\" 1\\' it is not a pleasurable experience.', 'I was disappointed with the 3x4x3 configuration on the aircraft. The services provided by the crew was pleasant the PTV was nice but what is bothering me the most are the seat width and access in/out of the seat. The seat width was really narrow and basically you would make contact with the passenger beside you all the time. And accessing in/out of the seat will disturb the passenger beside you which probably both of you will need to stand up for you to access out/in. The aisles are also narrow due to the 3x4x3 configuration. I really dislike this configuration.', 'Very narrow seats and aisles. Very uncomfortable if your neighbour is large. In the aisle seat you are continually knocked by staff passing up and down aisle. The good legroom is gained by reducing the cushioning on the seat so they soon become uncomfortable on a long flight. and if the person in front reclines the seat the advantage of the legroom is sacrificed.', 'Decently quiet aircraft but seats were too small especially considering the length of the journey (PEK- ADD 8hrs). Ethiopian should consider reducing the number of seats in the middle aisle to 3.', 'Legroom is good and the seats are comfortable', 'Auckland to Brisbane. We had chosen seats 52J and 52K bulkhead seats in the first row of the second economy class cabin which did offer more leg room. They are located next to the galley so you get a lot of noise from that area. This did not bother me at all but on a much longer flight if you wanted to sleep may have been a bad choice. The hot towels were very welcome and also the drink service was efficient. When the evening meal was served we seemed to wait ages for the cart to appear at our row. We were offered the choice offered on the menu of Beef or Salmon and then immediately told the Salmon had run out some time ago. Then why offer it? Our row was not offered tea or coffee during the meal service. Just prior to landing the female flight attendant decided to tidy her hair and apply make-up in the galley mirror which took some time she should have done this out of sight of passengers. I think Singapore and Thai in my opinion offer much more for economy passengers.', 'I am 175 cm tall and weight 78 kg. FRA via DXB to PER and back. Seat comfort is comparable to a cheap charter airline. I cannot understand how Emirates has such a good performance rating. We were so disappointed to Emirates because of the service and the quality of seating. I am sure we will choose for our next longhaul flight SIA again. SIA and THAI has a better Service and better seating comfort.', 'I have made many long haul flights out of Washington DC including some 17 hour flights to Narita Japan but this 14 hour flight was by far the worst and most uncomfortable journey I have ever made. I usually get up frequently to help with leg swelling but sitting in the middle of the 4 pack of seats was nearly impossible getting out even for me as a 5\\'7\" thin build woman. General back pain and discomfort for the entire flight. I wish I could say the entertainment made up for it but it was in no way worth it over other comparative flying experiences I have had on airlines like British Airways and Qatar. I was generally looking forward to flying Emirates after hearing great things but do your body a favor and avoid this economy flight if at all possible.', 'I really do not know how all the other airlines have much more space than this one. First of all how can they be number 1 airline when economy seats are totally uncomfortable? Configuration 3x4x3 is too much because as a passenger you do not have enough space and also for cabin crew who are struggling to pass with all service trolleys. Also between the services you need to be careful not to be hit by cart on - knee leg or shoulder. As someone mentioned before it is so poor ambience when you see full cabin with all the luggage bags and poor cabin crew who do not have space for all this stuff. What are they willing to do just to have more money?', 'The A380 is great and Economy class BKK - Hong Kong is really acceptable. Good food and decent entertainment but they did not offer wine and passengers did not know you had to ask for it. The one thing I did not like was the quality of the headphones and the background hiss was awful however I also have a hearing problem but this was terrible. I ended up watching a film on the laptop.', 'We flew with A380. The seats with this headrest behind your head is a disaster. Your head is pressed forward all the time - many people were complaining about this. You cannot sit relaxed with your head to the back like in the normal Boeing.', 'The seats are not wide enough at all the return flight my backside started to ache as 7 hrs is a long flight on uncomfortable seats. TV is OK but the system is dated on the 777 and was a bit grubby. I flew on 3 of these and only one had a nice TV on the other hand the A380 was much more comfortable and a much better flight I guess because of the added room.', 'The 3x4x3 seat configuration in a 777 is deeply uncomfortable and unsafe. I am not an unusual build for a western male at 6\\'2\" and 110 kilograms but I cannot get into anything but an aisle seat where the aisle is so narrow that cabin staff have to ask me to move my upper body across the neighbouring passenger so they can get their trolleys past me. The risk of having scalding water spilt all over me while they are serving coffee is always there and it does happen although not to me yet. I understand Qatar have a 3x3x3 configuration I think that is my next airline.', 'Seat was narrow as many other people have mentioned. Legroom was okay but I was never comfortable - fortunately my flight was only 7 hours (MEL-SIN). The squab seems to move when the seat is reclined meaning most people did not try to recline their seats - which helped with room for the knees.', 'Good seat was able to sleep. The bottom half moves forward when the back is reclined offering better comfort.', 'It was my first flight with Emirates and with an A380 and I (192m) had enough space for my long legs which is not usual in economy-class when you are tall. While I slept my legs touched the seat in front of me but I am used to that. People of \"normal\" size should not have problems with the space. The TV- Screen and the entertainment system was very good and had a large choice of movies and music.', \"The Boeing 777 was not designed for 3x4x3 seating. It's horrible and if you have the misfortune to be seated next to a larger person your 11 hour flight is truly miserable. Never again - Qatar for me from now on.\", 'All good except for the horrible cushioning. I had to tuck 3 pillows under me for the entire 7 hour flight.', 'First time on a B777-300ER. Seat 45C was the last seat before the rows with two seats started. Good recline (no one behind) but narrow seat and aisles are way too narrow so bumped constantly. Noisier than A380 so a long way (DBX-SYD) to put up with discomfort.', \"Manchester to Dubai. There were 3 of us travelling (2 adults and a 5 year old) and we had 3 of the centre 4 seats. Row 36 had a wall behind it but the seat seemed to fully recline and we could store pillows etc behind the seat and no one could kick us. We were close to the galley and toilet but that did not bother us. The seat had the new ICE which was fantastic with a huge range of movies tv shows and music and widescreen monitor. We were not bothered by the 4 seats in the middle it did not seem overly cramped and the lack of a footrest was fine. The recline was very good seat comfortable and I was able to stretch my legs under the seat in front. I am 5'11 and 15 stones. The food was very good and good choice of drinks.\", 'I travelled quite a few times in B777-300ER from DXB-GRU Flight time is around 14 hours. It is always very uncomfortable to seated in 3x4x3 configuration as compared to Qatar airways 3x3x3 configuration. Sadly Emirates sacrifices the economy passengers comfort for higher revenue per seat.', 'DEL-DXB-DEL A330s are the oldest aircraft in emirates fleet. Seats were not comfortable and meals served were just above average. Both flights were on time but staff was rude at delhi airport. Will prefer not to fly again.', 'Extremely difficult to get in and out if you are sitting not beside the aisle. Situation gets worse if you get a fairly big size passenger. Consolation was the in flight entertainment.', \"I flew Auckland to London with a 9 month old and I thought cabin crew and bulk head seats were excellent. I was nervous about flying on my own with a baby but had no problems. The passengers I sat next to we are very friendly and helpful which was a godsend. A380's have great space if you need to stretch your legs (this is compared to other planes you are still in a plane you are not going to be able to jog around). Food nice entertainment looked excellent seats were hard so had to try and work it a comfy position. Probably impossible. They were not worse than a lot of other airlines. Didn't like Dubai airport - so busy and airside hotel not open in the A380 terminal and after asking unhelpful customer services how I could get to the other terminals I only had an hour and they only had smoking rooms.\", 'Flew IAD-DXB in 28A and then DXB-IAD in 46K. The reviews you will read about the 2x4x2 section at the very rear of the aircraft are true. 46K had more legroom space between the seat and the window and an overall feeling of a bit more privacy. The cons to 46K are that the armrest between 46J and K is a permanent one that cannot be raised or lowered. This might have eaten into the already slim seat width a bit but it did not bother me being 5\\'8\" and average size. Another con to being at the very back of the plane is that it takes a long time to deplane and they were out of the meal I wanted by the time they got to me. 28A was just fine but only because there was no one in the middle seat next to me. Originally there was and after the doors we closed the FA came and found him an aisle seat to move to. Before he moved however I was already sore from leaning against the window just so our shoulders would not touch. Had he stayed there the entire 13.5 hours flight that would have been terrible. The 3x4x3 layout overall is a bad idea for passenger comfort. Not only are the seats shoulder- touchingly narrow but the other comments you have read about the aisle width are very true. I had to sidestep down the aisles to try and avoid bumping other passengers. And at meal/drink service time? Forget it. I did not have a problem with the lack of a footrest as some have commented. Sure it would have been nice to have but my feet touched the floor just fine and I am 5\\'8\". If this is a problem for you I had suggest using your carry on or as I read in a different forum bring a beach ball with you. When not inflated it takes up almost no room it costs $1 and if you partially inflate it it will not roll and makes a good makeshift footrest.', 'Seats 46A-B 46J-K and the same in row 47 are good seats on the B777. This is where the plane narrows so seating is now 2-4-2. There are 4 rows with 2 seats left and right but the best seats are row 46/47 you are far enough away from the toilets not to be bothered by pax queuing', \"Just perpetually uncomfortable. I am a male 6' and of average height. The only thing that makes Emirates economy class bearable is the entertainment. We're looking to fly to New Zealand next year and trawling the airlines to fly virtually anyone except Emirates.\", 'The seat goes up at the front and I had to take off my shoes and put my feet on them to avoid cutting the blood circulation. My wife put her feet on top of her handbag. There are no foot rests. I have another flight prebooked with Emirates but after that I will not use Emirates again. I have no idea what size person you would have to be to be comfortable on one of their planes.', 'The seats were decent enough for my liking. Not the best in the world or anything like that. Besides I did not really care all that much. I cared more about the legroom and head rest.The head room leaves much to be desired though.', 'I flew Emirates for the first time and this will be my last time on the 777-300 with their seat configuration of adding the extra seat to each row in economy. You could not walk down the aisle without bumping into some poor person sitting in the aisle seat. Which is probably your best seat if you do not want to feel too closed in. The narrow seats made the journey almost unbearable. I flew the 14 hour leg from Houston to Dubai then 10 hours to Perth Australia. The seats were just way to uncomfortable narrow and very little seat cushioning. I will return my loyal patronage back to Qantas for my USA - Australia hauls!', 'B777-300 3x4x3 seat layout horrific. No leg room very narrow seats. No footrests unable to recline chair due to pain in thighs. Pain in shoulders from leaning to left into window to avoid person in middle. This seating configuration would only be bearable for a short haul flight. 6.5 hours MRU-DXB very uncomfortable. Terrible swelling in feet and ankles. Very difficult to get out of seats. Unfortunate pax in middle has nowhere to go and has to use armrests unless they want to sit with their arms above their head. As soon as person in front reclines their seat you get cross eyes from trying to watch the IFE from a distance of around 3 inches.', 'Seats designed for sitting with infants on laps were assigned to people without any infants whereas people with infants had ordinary legroom seats. There was no assistance from staff to sort it out. Do not recommend Emirates for those who travel with infants since bassinet seats are not guaranteed/reserved.', 'I am short but wide and I have never been so uncomfortable in my life - eventually had to put the arm rest up just to breathe! When the seat is reclined your feet do not touch the floor and this makes it even more uncomfortable - worst flight of my life!', 'Dubai to Kuala Lumpur and had never seen a B777 with 3x4x3 configuration in economy class. It was without a doubt the worst flight I have ever flown as far as comfort. The flight was about 6 hours long. I thought Emirates was a top class airline. I was disappointed that they preferred to pack people in rather than aim for the comfort of its passengers. I requested an aisle seat and even the trolleys could hardly manage to make it through the aisles. Everyone had to walk sideways. I was hit and jostled constantly by people coming through (they could not help it). I am 1m73 and felt the seat already on my knees. When the person reclined it was even more uncomfortable. I spent most of the flight standing up rather than sitting in that uncomfortable seat. To make matters worse there was the video for the row in front of me on the floor where I should have been able to put my feet (the row in front was the exit row) so I could not even fully extend my legs! This was the first time and I hope the last time to fly Emirates.', 'We deliberately chose seats at the rear of the plane (47A/B) so we had more aisle space but we were unimpressed with the width of the seat the unforgivable lack of a footrest and the hardness of the seat. We are not seasoned travellers by any means but we expect a lot better than we got. We will not be using Emirates again.', 'The seat was comfortable enough at least more comfortable than that of Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines.', 'I prefer seats in the 777-300ER as I find them to be softer than the A380 and do not require the extra width offered on the bigger plane. A380 is not perfect but sitting anywhere for 14 hours is not going to be a great experience. The best seats are at the back of A380 ideally the row ahead of the crew sleeping section as they can be reclined without inconveniencing those behind you close proximity to the single rear toilet - if you are bored the crew often congregate at the rear and up for a chat.', 'Seats were comfortable (I was in the first row). The TV handle was rusty and 2 of the crew had to forcefully pull it out for me. My feet was rolled over twice by the food cart despite being kept within the boundaries of my seat area. No apology from the crew. Inflight entertainment breaks in between flight and during take off and landing, making it difficult to watch a show without being interrupted. Despite boarding on time, my luggage was shifted all the way behind by the staff (without asking/ seeking permission from me) when another passenger with a larger luggage came after me.', 'I am 186 cm tall and found seats on A380 comfortable. Leg room is bigger compared to other Emirates aircraft and seat width is ok.', 'Although seating is still 3-4-3 in the new A380Ã¢\\x80\\x99s the seats are wider better legroom and superior than B777-300ER aircraft in their fleet.', 'Seating felt like being squeezed in from side. Distance from other seat I think the worst I have seen. I thought Etihad being from UAE will be at par or better than Emirates - they proved me wrong. So far off from Emirates in everything that I am surprised that they are from same place. Anyway, one time was enough for me.', 'The 2x4x2 seat layout in economy on the A340-500 is roomier than the 3x4x3 layout on Etihad Airways Boeing 777s. The A340-500 seats are comfortable and cabin colours are easy on the eye.', 'The seats were horrible because when you recline the seats rises up and leave your feet dangling without a footrest. I complained to the flight-attendant and she told me yes she also finds it very uncomfortable as they took out all the footrests. For long haul flights you will get cramp and leg soreness without footrest. I will never fly Emirates again.', 'Most uncomfortable seats we have ever encountered on any airline. The seats are like sitting on bricks. I am only small so the legroom was adequate for me. However the seats were so uncomfortable that I had back pain throughout the whole 8 hours and then a second 4 hour flight. I tried using the airline pillow to ease my discomfort and ended up actually sitting on my own inflatable neck pillow and a blanket. My coccyx feels bruised it was unbearable. The inflight entertainment was good. It would not take much for the crew to actually smile but apparently this was too much effort. Would not use Etihad again.', 'The first and last legs were on the new A380. We booked early and sat almost at the front of Economy - small cabin loads of room. The longer leg to Perth was in a A330-200 and the difference was significant in that it was cramped and the seat was as hard as a park bench. Crew were excellent and professional. The IFE was good bar the endless repetitions of an advert for property in UAE at the beginning of each programme - wearing when you are binge watching! The food was fine and plentiful - no complaints about drinks service. Abu Dhabi airport is ok - like a small provincial shopping mall with planes parked outside. We managed to bag some floor space and crash out for a couple of hours. I thought Etihad were one of the best airlines we have been on (especially given the rock bottom prices) but the experience highlighted again the vast difference between the A380 and older smaller aircraft. If you can find someone who goes the whole way A380 then pick them and hopefully more airlines will buy them.', 'Rock hard seats. No leg space. Very narrow. I flew from DFW to Abu Dhabi 2/18 and returned on 3/8. In addition you have to deal with angry and unhappy cabin crew. One of the worst airlines I have flown in my lifetime.', 'This was the most uncomfortable seat I have ever encountered on an aircraft the seat itself was ok but as there was no footrest my feet did not touch the ground so I had to plie up cushions and wrap them in the blanket to put under my feet this was not ideal as the pains in my legs and feet spoiled the first few days of our holiday.', 'LHR-AUH-KUL A330. Return was B777 Jet airways configured aircraft then A380. Apart from the Jet Airways seats all seating was excellent with power point/usb in seats. A380 the seats were slightly wider.', 'AUH-LHR in economy class. Seating very disappointing. Fortunate enough to have emergency row seats so leg space not a problem. But the seat was so narrow hard and uncomfortable. This needs changing as it reflects badly.', 'Flew on Etihad on EY 131 AUH-IAD. Babies were crying throughout the flight and the flight attendants did not lift a finger. Leg room and seat is clearly below par. On top of that a flight that is clearly overbooked. Never again', 'Appalled at the 3x4x3 configuration in Economy class flying from Dubai to Perth. Felt cramped like sardines and claustrophobic and one of the most uncomfortable flights I have ever taken. Other passengers commented on poor conditions. I will not fly them again. Most other airlines would only have a 3x3x3 config in Economy on this type of aircraft or similar.', 'I think it is pretty poor for a non-charter airline to have 10 abreast seating in Y class on a 777. Even Saudia has now taken the cheap move of adding an extra seat in the 777 Y cabin!', '37C aisle seat. Too squashed for the 14 hour flight MEL to Abu Dhabi. I am not tall so legroom is okay but the seats are hard and are too squashed together. I could not use the armrest because the traveller next to me needed it. I felt the same on both long haul flights.', 'I wish I had read the comments on this forum before I booked. How Etihad has won awards I will never know. Such cramped conditions should be illegal. The economy class comfort and configuration on the B777-300 is the worst I have ever experienced for a long haul of 15 hours. Tiny hard seats. ZERO leg room. Fine if you are a child but not for adults. No easy access to water. You have to get up and ask or occasionally crew come around with some outside of meal times. Never again Etihad. You are beyond disappointing.', 'The seats on this airline are so uncomfortable we could not get comfortable and were glad to get off the plane in the airports we stopped off at. We would never travel with this airline again.', 'Lack of footrests causing the most horrifically uncomfortable pain in the back of the thighs. Severe swelling in ankles and legs for days after. You cannot do in-flight exercises and walking up & down the aisle for 8 hours.

Seats are too narrow leg room is non existent.', 'Very cramped seats. My last connecting flight was on IndiGo and their seat arrangements are more spacious and offer more leg room than Etihad.', 'I sat in 54K as it had been recommended as being more comfortable. Unfortunately a blind gentleman was sat next to me which was not the problem but the Flight Attendants were barely interested and in the end I had to look after him opening his meals cutting up his food and taking him to the toilet. The Flight Attendants only came to assist when I asked them too. The seats are very narrow and tray tables did not sit flat meaning you had to be careful when eating.', \"Boeing 777 seats on the 12.5 hour leg were a nightmare. Narrowness and poor leg room made the experience torture! I understand from other reviewers that this was due to the way the airline configures the seating in economy. At best the service was indifferent liberally spiced with rudeness. Despite being a party of 5 we had trouble stowing our 3 standard carry on cases. When the compartment could not close the stewardess said that I would have to find another place to put them. My wife and I eventually found space 3 rows behind our seats. Sitting on the isle allowed me to be bumped in the shoulder by staff regularly throughout the trip. No acknowledgement or apologies received typified the standard of the service. We could not understand how the airline was 'award winning' based on experiencing both trips. I was able to get a laugh from the Etihad Airline's approach to censoring movies. (eg in The Monuments Men there were fuzzy spots strategically placed on famous works of art to protect the viewer's sensibilities!) If only they put the same care and attention into the service.\", 'The seat gives you a terrible pain in the back of your thighs due to the foot rest been removed. I could not get comfortable on either sectors of my journey and found the only way around this was to sit upright. The meal tray does not slide towards you like on some other airlines which means you find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat. Big improvements are needed for this aircraft.', \"I flew on EEVA Air's newest 777 to Los Angeles. The TV screen is huge (Panasonic new EX3) entertainment system. The new seats has bigger space, and the seat is also softer. I hope EVA Air will install its newest economy class on all its Boeing 777 and A330 aircraft.\", 'Without doubt the most uncomfortable flight I have had seats are extremely cramped. This is made completely unbearable as soon as the person in front of you reclines. It becomes impossible to view your screen unless you recline yourself. Service was limited and drinks needed to be requested they were not bought around on a regular basis. If you want economy consider another airline.', 'I am a short person yet I found the seats on Etihad flight from Toronto to Abu Dhabi to be the worst I have ever found on an airplane. The seats are not wide enough and there is no leg room (even for a short person). It was a seriously uncomfortable 12 hour flight enough for me to never want to fly Etihad again. Strangely enough the onward connecting flight to Islamabad had decent seats although that was also a B777 but apparently the aircraft belonged to a partner airline. Etihad is trying to milk as many passengers as they can using the high density 10 abreast with minimum seat pitch. Absolutely terrible experience.', 'I had read the reviews which are mostly negative and the splattering of positive reviews prior to flying. After flying with them I can honestly say the negative are correct and I am somewhat dubious if the positive are real. No leg room unless you pay extra for leg room cost me $134 Australian dollars. Narrowest seats in the market and their entertainment system had to be rebooted 3 times. The staff were the only positive attribute. Fly Emirates or Virgin they actually seem to care more I have complained since returning. It took them 4 days to reply with a very basic holding email.', 'Having read other reviews of the Etihad Economy seat on the 3x4x3 B777 we decided to pay extra to get an exit seat. This was well worth it but still not good. With 10 seats across the seats are so narrow that you can hardly move (I am 1.82 and normal weight) This seems even worse at the exit row as your tv screen and table are stored between the seats. However fortunately you have legroom. I cannot imagine having done a flight on any other seat in the economy cabin as the legroom is really non-existent (I tried it) and together with the lack of width it makes for a combination from hell. My travel partner is 1.72m and even he found it extremely difficult. Moreover a crew member on passive transfer sat on the jump seat facing us and spread her luggage out on the floor during the flight so we could not actually stretch our legs even if we had paid extra for exactly that.', 'I do not like that you cannot get your seat assigned on some legs (Dubai-Houston) until checking in. The 3-4-3 seat arrangement in Economy makes for extremely narrow seats which create an uncomfortable flight experience. Sitting in an aisle seat means your shoulder will be banged repeatedly by anyone walking by or by passing carts. It is reason to fly another airline.', 'LHR BKK LHR Premium Economy 2nd April 2015 - 19th April 2015. I chose EVA Air premium economy because I wanted that little bit extra legroom and width of seat for a non stop 11 hours flight. I found the flight both comfortable and relaxing. I was able to fall asleep for at least 5 on both legs and the TV in-flight service was excellent. The only annoying part of the flight was the fact that the in-flight box is situated in the seat underneath in front and therefore prohibits foot movement to a certain extent. The meals were good and fresh. I paid around Ãƒ\\x82GBP900 return for the experience which was great value. Eva are a good airline and the attendants are very pleasant and cheerful. However the flight outward was 2 hours late departing from LHR so some transfers to other flights in BKK were missed.', 'My husband and I fly to Bangkok at least 5 times a year and I would highly recommend EVA Air. Staff are extremely professional and do not disturb you unlike other airlines we have flown. Although the food is not great again it is better than a lot of airlines. In economy I can sleep for 6-8 hours undisturbed however my husband can get 3-4 hours. Pretty good considering. If you want to get upgraded EVA Air is not the company to go with. In the years we have flown with them not once have we been lucky!', 'On average a good seat bearing in mind the 11 hours flight to BKK. Though the pitch could be a bit bigger. A disadvantage of the isle seats though is the placement of the boxes for the inflight entertainment system. In economy I prefer to sit as much in front of this class as possible.', 'Unlike their B777 the Etihad A330-200 offered relatively comfortable economy seating. The 2x4x2 configuration makes it easy for anyone to get in and out and the seat width and comfort was acceptable and better than many European airlines. Recline was okay and the screen worked well. Leg room was not impressive but on par with most airlines. All in all recommendable.', 'I am a small person and having issues with the leg room. Should have more leg room.', 'Flying Emirates was the most uncomfortable flight we have ever done. I was expecting the seat to be narrow but the width was OK. Legroom was not too bad but my legs dangled in mid-air the entire time with horrible discomfort under the lower thighs. Also the seating is incredibly hard and unyielding just could not get my head comfortable and my shoulders and neck still ache 3 days post-flight. We could not sleep on the Dubai-Perth leg as the people behind found the legroom too short and kept pushing our seats back whenever we reclined them. Terribly uncomfortable we will never fly with them again.', 'Do not travel on these Emirates aircraft. The seats are excruciatingly uncomfortable as the footrests have been removed. This causes pressure behind the lower thighs since there is no other leg support. It is virtually impossible to get comfortable. After 16 hours I was exhausted. Many passengers complained - response from Emirates has been disappointing.', 'EVA Air should check the aircraft air conditioning systems. My flight BR12 was just too hot! It made the flight very uncomfortable. Cabin crew service was superb though. But please adjust the cabin temp to be cooler. That was my 3rd flight with them that has the same problem.', \"Spent the extra money on Elite Class and was quite excited until I sat down and saw the oversized entertainment box right directly where my legs should have gone. This is for window seats row A. All the window seats (and in K too) seemed to have this same problem. As a result you either have to sit diagonally with both legs on the left side or do the splits with a leg on each side but the problem with this is that the left leg's calf muscle will have the corner of the foot rest jar up into the muscle causing pain after some time. Also when fully reclined it is difficult to get your feet under the seat in front of you. The concept is good but the execution is utterly terrible and I was very disappointed not to sleep for the 10-hour flight because of constantly trying to juggle one of the above two positions neither of which worked. Shame on the engineers here.\", 'Thought that flying Premium Economy would give us a little extra but found that it did not add much that you get in Economy with other airlines. We were sat on the left hand side right over the engines (seats 24 A & B) which was very noisy and bumpy. The seats are some of the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in for an 8 hour flight with a leg rest that leaves your feet dangling and cuts into the calfs of your legs. When the seat in front was reclined I had 2 inches between my knees and the back of that seat. Because of the boxes around the chair anchor points I was made completely immobile with nowhere to put my feet and had to sit in a skewed position with both legs bent to the right. The food was not too good either. I ended the flight feeling very stiff and sore. I was expecting Premium Economy but only had Economy service.', 'The seats on A330 flight pleasant because they did not use a configuration that just crams as many seats as possible. The Boeing 777 seats are unbearable pitch is limited and the seat width is horrendous. Avoid the Etihad Airways 10-abreast (3x4x3) Boeing 777 seat arrangement at all costs. AVOD options fantastic but not enough to take away from the narrow seats on the Boeing 777.', 'Sydney to Abu Dhabi 14 hrs in the worst seats I have ever tried to sit in.

I was almost deafened by excessive noise from the aircraft engines? I was not impressed by the seat width or leg room and this aircraft performs poorly against Singapore Airlines for long haul. My blanket although in a sealed bag on opening was disgustingly dirty with food particles stuck to it! When I asked for another I was met with rudeness. We found the staff to be unhelpful. My entertainment system had to be rebooted. Our food was ok but there were no extra snacks during the flight. I was seriously disappointed with Etihad as I had thought from adverts that they were committed to great service and quality - but this is not the case in economy. Also the staff never checked seat belts once and I certainly did not feel that in an emergency situation I would be relying on them for help which is standard in most airlines. I would not book Etihad again in a hurry I will stick with Singapore.', 'Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi and onward to Bangkok. Seats on first flight were very cramped. My first reaction was never again. I have a normal size( 185 ). The seat on the second part( 777) was reasonable. On return flight same again. However I flew from Abu Dhabi to Dusseldorf with Air Berlin. Etihad has a coop with Air Berlin. It should be forbidden by law! I could not move for 8.5 hours. Seats are not even okay for a short charter flight. Next time it is Qatar Airways again for me.', 'Seats are too narrow and has been said many times the configuration means narrow aisles.', 'I had an aisle seat but was totally cramped seat width was terrible I was struck on the shoulder quite violently by passing trolleys more than four times. My knees touched the seat in front and of course the person in front reclined his seat making the screen virtually unviewable and the meals tray inaccessible.', 'The lack of a footrest made it uncomfortable even for a tall guy like me. I am lean but I think these seats will be uncomfortable for a stocky person.

The service was not the best either.', 'On a 20hr flight to BKK via Taipei I flew economy class. I was surprised how short the seat pitch was. Seating in a window seat proved difficult getting in/out of when two other passengers were sound asleep. With barely enough room for my carry on it was reduced even more when in the recline position as the footrest took up additional space. The seat in front of me reclined is seat and almost cracked the top of my laptop. The connecting flight was no improvement as my leg room was confiscated by the IFE box located in the seat in front of me.

Avoid middle seats altogether as they are cramped and not wide enough for big people.', \"The other reviews here are right - basically the economy seat on the 777-300ER is both too narrow and close to the seat in front and the combination is deadly - if they took out about 20 seats and fixed either the pitch or the width it would be fine. A shame as the rest of the product - service food entertainment etc. is first class.

Cramped with little to no space on board. Prepare to be squeezed into the smallest economy seat ever! I flew on Bangkok Airways 2 days later to Siem Reap and they had a lot more legroom in their standard economy seats on an A320. I am going to be switching away from Etihad despite just becoming a silver card Etihad guest member - I cannot fly comfortably in economy (for reference I am not over weight or tall!)', 'The seats are far too cramped for my liking and seat configuration on long-haul flights is terrible..

They endlessly plug an award at Etihad and on close inspection it seems that Abu Dhabi oil dollars might be more important than merit!', 'The legroom in this aircraft is a disgrace considering Etihad advertise comfort and show aircraft leg room in economy as roomy. This is not the case - I am not a tall person and found it to be extremely uncomfortable especially on a near 14 hour flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi.

These seats are very comfortable and we slept 9 hours out of 14 from TPE-LAX. If you are after seat pitch then row 68 (the window seats on both sides) offer more legroom than others due to the curvature of the cabin and the spacing of the rows - although consequently the aisle seats in these blocks appear to have slightly reduced seatpitch - so access past a neighbour could be an issue. IFE good and easy to use.', 'Good bang for your buck type of deal. The seat is pretty good for economy although lacks some spacious qualities its not that bad. I had an emergency exit/aisle seat so I was extremely happy with my seat leg room and mobility.

Agree that the footrest is always in the way up or down.', \"The problem starts with the 3-4-3 seat configuration in all B777's by adding an extra seat to the normal 3-3-3 configuration.

Row 1 seats recline to the point where they trap passengers in Row 2 with minimal space between rows and making is completely impossible to leave your seat during the flight. There is little equality in this booking class - Row 1 seems reasonable whereas Rows 2 and 3 seem like cages. A colleague in Row 3 experienced similar problems as I did: her seat reclined only part way and when the seat in front was fully reclines, she was unable to escape the fact that the seatback was so close to her face that eating a meal became an exercise in contortion. This seat configuration is a by-product of Jetstar squeezing in those extra seat rows to maximise their profit.

I am about to end my long term relationship with KLM after this. I am 1.95m tall and not so thin, and was sitting with my wife and son in row 33 (all 3 seats), I was in the aisle seat. It was physically impossible for me to sit with my legs straight out in front of me there simply was not enough room to fit my bones between the seats, so I had to splay my legs outwards. On the outward aisle side my leg could not fit under the arm rest (which is fixed and cannot move up) so it was digging into the top of my leg all the time. On the inside my leg was now in my son's seat space and my feet could not get under the seat due to the box on the floor. My son is also over 1.90m so he was already experiencing similar issues, without me using his leg room. All this was without the person in front reclining their seat. We tried to lift the armrests to collectively give us more space, but they only go to about 45 degrees as they simply cannot fit between the seats at chest height so these were at best under my armpits. Third issue: just sitting in the seat my shoulder was touching my sons shoulder, pure and simply the seats are only as wide as a person, nothing more. Fourth issue: if my wife or son wanted to go to the toilet they had to climb over me to get out. Not ideal but if were not family this is extremely unpleasant for everyone involved. Bottom line: this is the worst long haul flight I have ever made with KLM, or any airline come to that. This has never happened to me before outside of one other (also with KLM) experience on a short haul flight (~2 hours), but for an intercontinental flight of ~10 hours this is terrible. Economy means budget and therefore maybe some discomfort, but it should never result in physical pain to anyone, or offensive intrusion of one passengers legs into another passengers seat space. In my 25 years flying with KLM this problem has only got worse, but became critical around the time KLM merged with Air France. KLM's relationship with it is passenger's has deteriorated to one of simply money - everyone buys a basic seat, but if you are tall or not thin then we (KLM) know you will probably pay even more to get a slightly better seat. There is no concept of building a long term relationship with customers, or meeting their needs, so long as we make a few bucks out of you, we are happy even though we know you are not. Extremely short sighted and selfish attitude from a long time national carrier that should know and aspire to something better. KLM may think all its customers look at is the bottom line and that cheap is the name of the game, but if that is the case then why do they offer lots of seats at extra expense to avoid incredibly bad seat conditions. It might surprise you to learn that if I am going to have to pay a bit more to get a better seat then I had be prepared to pay it up front to guarantee seat quality and comfort! That attitude builds customer loyalty and satisfaction, not fear, discomfort and pain!\", \"AMS-CPT, the new economy seat on this 11hrs day flight. The screen resolution is great, impressive movie selection. Music selection was very poor. The legroom (I'm 1.83) was very fine, seat is on the narrow side, I played elbow with the elderly guy sitting next to me for the whole flight.

On a long flight (17hrs) I really suffered due to the narrow seat. I was sitting shoulder to shoulder with the passenger next to me and I am not exaggerating!', \"Flew from SIN to AMS return. Very very poor economy class seat especially for intercontinental flights above 10 hours. Seats are extremely squeezy (not sure why KLM adopted a 3x4x3 seat layout when other long haul airlines rarely do). Recline is absolutely horrendous for a overnight flight - the seat was definitely not suitable for a night's sleep maybe only a short 30 minutes nap. Furthermore KLM's economy class tickets are not cheap - merely cheaper than top notch Singapore Airlines by 120 euros. Therefore I do not get why KLM is so cheapskate to pack so many people in economy class on very poor quality seats.

Was on the third leg of a 27 hour trip so tensions were already high when I walked on board. I was met with an archaic plane with the worst seats I have ever encountered on an international carrier. At 6'5 I usually sit in an aisle seat to gain some extra legroom however half my legroom was eradicated by a large metal box which were under every aisle seat. My extendable head rest would not stay in an extended position and my seat would not recline. My screen was also awful and unwatchable. When I asked to be reseated they told me no other seats were available despite the plane being 80% full and them trying to sell the premium economy seats before takeoff. After a 3 hours struggle to fall asleep my knee was hit by the steward and his cart waking me up and hurting my knee no apology or even acknowledgement was given. I complained to the customer service manager about the whole fiasco who simply said If I do not like it do not fly with them again.

KLM placed in the 2 seats next to me a couple with a 1 yr old infant and it was hell during the flight duration. The poor child has been crying and kicking me all night long and the mum that was seating beside me found nothing else to do to calm him down that shaking him nervously and shouting \"shhhhh\" at him all the time. The cabin staff came on a few occasions asking the dad to walk around with the child but that was clearly not enough to give a chance to enjoy the extra legroom and give me a chance to close my eyes. This was a very lousy experience that I do not wish to anyone.

IFE is good, table is smart, but the legroom is limited and seats are very narrow. You literally touch your neigbour with your shoulders. Short flights are okay, but I can not imagine flying 10+ hours there.', 'Window seat 21J in Economy. Short-haul flight from WAW to LHR around 2 hours 45 minutes in the air. Seat is reasonably comfortable for this length of flight but I do not think it would be comfortable for long-haul flights. Overall the seats are no better than in their 737s or Embraer aircraft. Foot rests are available but I never use them. I am of average height but tall people would struggle to get comfortable. The seat belt kept coming loose during the flight which is a concern in such a new aircraft.', 'Most of the seats in economy are very very old and worn out. What I found was that on most if not all of the seats in economy section the buttons are completely worn out. There is virtually no bottom support just a hole.', \"My seat was 7C and it was one of the worst seats for a 8+ hour flight. It was so worn by use one's body could not sit naturally in it. You felt yourself slouching or sliding forward the whole time and could not correct yourself. LOT also does not have video on each seat instead it is a projector at the front of the cabin so the closer you are to rows 5 or 19 the better view of the video screen (which randomly turns on and off). Lastly the sound quality and physical/mechanical quality of the headphone inputs were horrible!\", 'For a 1.90m tall and big man, I really felt relived when sitting in the new premium economy seats for the first time. Seats are wide and there is enough leg room for a comfortable sleep. Screens are bigger than in economy and seats can be pushed back further for extra sleeping comfort. Good product.', 'Boeing 747-8i HKG-FRA-HKG in Premium Economy of LH and its a great products. Seats are comfortable and offer the right amount of space. Also compared to other Premium Economy airlines (CX, TK, BA etc.) LH plays in the top league. Legroom is good compared to other carriers, seat-pitch is good, IFE is great, and the service / food offered is all a good value for money. The only weird point on the Lufthansa Premium Economy is that its locked between two Economy class cabin areas and the passengers were quite confused - seeing some of the nice Premium Economy seats are empty and they cannot sit there (as Cabin crew explained them only against paying a charge etc.) A better location or clear partition would be nicer.', \"I have just had the worst flight experience over the last 20 years. GRU-MUN flight of June 5 on Lufthansa's A340-600 was ok. My friend and I managed to get joint seats on one side of the plane. Legroom was fine though the seats were kind of narrow and thinly padded. Our flight back on a Boeing 747-8, however, was a nightmare all thanks to the seats being even narrower, the legroom non-existent, no to mention these metal boxes attached to the floor right under the seat in front of you, which reduced your legroom even more. Initially I got bulkhead seat (18F) in the 4-seat row. If you think the regular seats are narrow, wait until you see the bulkhead ones. Because the armrests are fixed your legs are literally squeezed. I looked behind me and there was a vacant middle seat to which I moved right before take off. But that did not do it either. I called the staff to ask for an upgrade to the Premium Class but it cost 399 euros. So my colleague, who had an aisle seat on the same row, was nice enough to trade places with me so I could have a little more room. But sleeping is out of question on such seats. I practically got no sleep at all, just like some passengers who'd rather stand up during the whole flight than being squeezed on a seat. Food was nice and so was the crew, but I vow never to flight coach on Lufhansa again.\", 'Shanghai to Frankfurt. The Lufthansa A380 Economy Class is pretty good. The legroom is good and the seat width is the same as in any other A380 on the world. IFE Selection is very good and you can get easily out of your seat.', 'Seat 14C enough for 1.90m person even to stretch legs. Pleasantly surprised.', \"The seats look fancy but do not offer any comfort and especially no lumbar support at all. Plus the distance between the seat rows is very narrow especially if one is just little bit taller. It's a pain getting into the seat if your seat is not an aisle seat. This definitely got worse over the last 7 years. Plus the space to stow some small items like a case for glasses or a small bottle of water basically disappeared over the years.\", 'Munich to LAX - 40c. A very large passenger in the seat ahead of me kept her seat in full recline throughout the flight making it near impossible for me to eat or exit the seat. Also because of the fixed aisle armrest I literally needed to climb into my seat in order to step out into the aisle. This also put the monitor so close to my face that eye strain kept me from using the entertainment system to get a break from the torture. I will never again fly nonstop from Europe to the west coast of the US. The crew was friendly.', 'I was fortunate enough to get a bulkhead seat and therefore extra legroom on the first flight. In this row the armrests are immovable which is probably the only thing that kept the gentleman beside me from lying completely on me. The seats are narrow thinly padded and uncomfortable. On the return flight I was alone in one of the two seat rows and still had difficulty getting in and out of the row without disturbing the row in front of me. Thankful it was only a 6 hour flight. That was miserable enough.', \"The Recaro seat is a slim seat but in my point of view it is not too slim so that you are not able to feel what the person behind you is doing. It get's the full seat rating because for a 1h to 3h flight it is perfect.\", \"Route: CDG-FRA-GRU - I used to fly Lufthansa's 747-400 on coach class and it always was ok by the money you put in the ticket. But this time I was excited to try the brand new 747-8 thinking it would be more spacious and comfortable than the old 400s. My mistake. The truth is they shrank the space in the coach class and created a more spacious Business and First Class. More than half of the 747's main deck is dedicated to First and Business while 262 coach passengers are squeezed on the rear. I am 1.80m tall and it was very difficult to me to find a nice position to rest and relax. Absolutely no sleeping during the 11 hours flight! To make it even worse the flight was completely full. The good things? The staff was nice and friendly the food was good and there was plenty of drinks you do not use to find in someone's else coach class. On the first flight's leg (CDG-FRA) I travelled on a LH A321 which was much more comfortable and spacious than the long haul 747. This is happening not only on Lufthansa but in several other airlines I have flown lately like United Airlines TAM Airlines Delta etc. Lufthansa again? Only if I get a business or first class ticket.\", 'IAD-FRA. There is a metal IFE box under each seat E making the leg room for the passengers in these seats virtually non-existent (especially when neighbouring seats are full). The plane was not entirely full and everyone was avoiding Es like a plague. In the end I managed to snatch an aisle seat (smaller IFE box but more leg room in the walkway). The FA refused to acknowledge that there is an IFE box in the legroom (was not complaining just informing her why I would like to change seats). If plane is close to capacity it is horrendous. Leg room is ridiculous. Seats tough and no padding. Personal space is zilch. On the plus side food was good and alcohol was freely available - but given the atrocity of seats take all the wine you can get.', 'Seat 16D Newark to Dusseldorf Germany and on the return similar but the front row between economy and business class. I like this airline and generally love the A340 but I do think this airline is letting its customers down with seat comfort. The online entertainment system was superb and came with USB charger ports for phones and stuff. Meal service was also very solid.', 'SIN-FRA The seat is uncomfortable for someone of my size (1.90 m). I was lucky to sit at the emergency exit so legroom was not a problem. In the normal rows I can barely squeeze in (I tried). Also the seat is barely wide enough to sit in. Consequently there is not enough space for the upper body. I had physical contact with my neighbour the whole time. The seat is also quite hard. The only good thing I can say is the head rest. You can adapt it to keep your head from rolling to the side so you will not need a neck pillow.', 'Seat 16D Newark to Dusseldorf Germany and on the return similar but the front row between economy and business class.

The online entertainment system was superb and came with USB charger ports for phones and stuff. Meal service was also very solid.', 'Would have given the review 3 stars had it not been for the extra legroom I received. I was in seat 27G which is the second row of Economy seats now the reason for the extra legroom is the fact that the plane layout goes from a 2x3x2 to a 2x4x2 in row 27. Seat G is basically halfway in the aisle. however the rest of the row is god awful because the seats are not perfectly aligned and therefore every seat has immovable armrests for tray tables but the video screens are still on the seat in front giving a very crooked view. Honestly it is the most aggravating thing. Another huge reason for the low score is the bathrooms. Lufthansa has a neat little feature where they place all economy bathrooms downstairs on the bottom deck. This is really cool however there are only 5 of them. The flight attendants also have to guard the stairs to make sure that crowding does not occur. They vigilantly stand guard and make sure a line of no more than 5 people forms (which happens rather quickly). Almost impossible to use the restroom.', 'For seat 21A/B/H/J you have to pay an extra 6000 Euros. No window (as on row 20 also). If you believe you can spread your legs forget it. People are queuing all night long waiting to go to the toilets. Much too few toilets in the economy class. Toilet light annoying during the 12 hours fly. Unable to sleep.', 'While Lufthansa has better leg room than most it is not great and sleep in is just awkward. However the A380 does give much more luggage space above the seats so you can avoid putting things under the seat in front which is better. The seats have an ethernet jack and USB port but NO power sockets. Wifi is available at a small price; but using Wifi uses much more battery power in your laptop. Unless you are very lucky with battery life having no power socket is a serious disadvantage especially for cost conscious business travelers - but then again Lufthansa would like to see those in Business class anyway which is not always possible. This negates the advantage of having Wifi available. The inflight entertainment system has an OK range of films and programmes. You can normally find 4-5 hours of viewing from the selection. The system however is quite slow and the touchscreens very temperamental. If you want more then bring a tablet computer with a long battery life loaded with films and avoid Wifi. The upside of Lufthansa is excellent service from cabin crew who seem to be constantly available if you need help.', 'Toronto to Frankfurt return. Like sitting on a kitchen chair for 7 hours. To get up to use washroom facilities nearly impossible which makes me wonder how you would evacuate the plane in an emergency? I am 5/2 120lbs got hit in by seat in front of me while that passenger reclined his seat. Table was bent there for food tray tended to slide off was told to hold the tray in place to keep it from sliding. Cup holder broke on husbands knee when seat in front of him was reclined. Cabin crew (not all ) had attitude. This flight was booked with Air Canada. Will definitely double check next time.', 'I will not fly Lufthansa Economy again. Don\\'t get me wrong the staff was excellent service was highly efficient and the food was reasonable. The seating however was so bad it is hard to describe. Probably the best way to describe it is that it is claustrophobic. I am 6\\'1\" 200lbs broad shouldered 55 yrs old. I was in the aisle seat and next to me sat a woman who was probably 250lbs. There was zero personal space between us. In front of me was a passenger who insisted on having his seat fully reclined making the viewing of the seat monitor difficult because it was just too close. 12 hours of being squeezed into a configuration which left me feeling compelled to take a very long shower as soon as I could after arrival. I am absolutely confounded as to why Lufthansa chooses to treat its Economy customers like cattle!', 'My ticket did not allow any pre reservation in the web site so I paid around 25 Euros to reserve an aisle seat. (43G). At check in I was informed there was no reservation for me although it was in the screen 43G. After a while and discussion from desk office to the flight manager they gave me 18C.

Huge disappointment. Never again A380 and if possible will avoid Lufthansa.

I prefer South African Airways.', 'FRA-YVR. It has been a few years since I flew with Lufthansa on North America routes. The catering was exceptionally well executed cabin crew was friendly and the 747-400 with the Touch Screen Audio Visual was what long haul flight needed.

Seats in economy are uncomfortable. I do not understand how Germans who are tall and flying this airline most would be return customers. Every US airline provides better seat pitch. Service was ok but nothing spectacular. Just get job done kind of service. Disappointed. Just not enough seat pitch.', 'Steerage class seat 41J. Middle of the three right window seats in last section of cabin. Fantastic airline. The seats are a bit narrower than other airlines but not noticeable to me. And I am 5\\'11\" 185 lbs. When reclining the bottom portion slides forward a bit; again makes no difference to me. The real stickler is that the seat tracks will end up between your feet. Really annoying if there are carry-ons stuffed down there. Why do I rate high? These are the only seats I can sit in for 10+ hours and my ass not get sore or fall asleep. No need for awkward shuffling around to get some circulation going. Maybe it is the padding maybe it is because the equipment is new or maybe because Recaro really knows how to make seats. Either way I like them. Not included in the rating is the service: Outstanding. Not the standard drink meal drink meal service. They offer lots of drinks. And when it is nap time aboard and the lights dimmed a little counter by the galley is constantly re-stocked with snacks and refreshments (including beer I think Lufthansa really wants people to drink beer). Snacks include pretzels and Toblerone chocolate.', 'One of the worst long-haul flights I have experienced MUC-Shanghai. I am 18 m (5`8) which means I am not a giant but even with an aisle seat its impossible to stand up without waking up the person in front of you never mind eating while you have a neighbour in the row. Its almost impossible to stretch out and the entertainment system only reacts once you press the screen very hard which of course bothers the person in front of you.', 'I am 6\\'3\". I was in a window seat. It was terrible. I could not move my legs at all. I was not expecting to be comfortable but I did not expect it to be as bad as it was. When the person in front of me tried to recline his seat I had to tell him to put the seat back up as my knees were smashed. Why does not LH offer a premium economy seat? I will stick with United even with the older planes and poor cabin crew service at least I can have a seat with some leg room. I will avoid Lufthansa\\'s A380 at all cost.', \"I was sort of looking forward to check the new Lufthansa's 747-8 seat but to be honest not much change compared to old 747-400. What is more the annoying metal box of IFE was present under the window seat something similar to a340-600. Overall the seats are not worse than other airlines - in this manner they can be recommended but do not expect too much.\", \"Lufthansa's regional seat is very good. Whilst the actual stated pitch does not sound great they have really thought about how to maximise legroom: the safety and shopping guides are placed high up the seat in front and the seat is somehow very thin and very comfortable. Obviously there was no IFE and we only got a snack and an alcoholic drink but this was perfectly fine on a 1 hour flight. The cabin crew were efficient and effective although they did seem to leave it late to serve the snack.\", 'I traveled from Sao Paulo Brazil to Munich Germany. Nice and neat plane excellent crew but the seats - totally unacceptable. I paid an extra charge to have more legs room on the emergency exit row but the seat width is a real problem. Any adult with a regular shoulder width will exceed the limits of the seat back. Since seats are to close to each other this means you and your neighbor will travel shoulder to shoulder pushing for space along the whole 12 ours trip.', 'We sat in seats 56HK and I am 6ft and of reasonable build. The seats are pretty thin and firm but I had no problems getting and staying comfortable for our 11 hour flight. Legroom was adequate (which is all you will ever get) and as it is 2x4x2 it is not really that hard getting out of the window seats. IFE was pretty good - not the largest range of films available about 40 or so but there was at least 5 I would have watched. Service was excellent and food was okay.

Tall people with kids who cannot claim the emergency exit should target the first row in Economy class on outer two seats.', 'Singapore - Kuala Lumpur - Auckland (Return). Boarding was delayed. There were many Indian nationals onboard which resulted with many special meals (vegetarians etc.) However many of them \"preferred\" to switch seats which made meal service very frustrating for the crews plus it was a full load flight. I do not blame them. I sat on the left aisle towards the back of the plane. Recline was minimal but that did not stop me from sleeping. It was an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Auckland. There were no flight map indication on the IFEs so I had no idea where we were flying throughout the entire flight. Food was not worth talking about I do not really care for it. I am thankful I had a considerate neighbour next to me who scooched towards the window while he sleeps leaving me a little bit more space. Legroom wise it was ok. I am 1.85m tall and my legs fit snugly in the seat. However there is more than enough space when I straighten my legs underneath the seat. Pretty much slept the entire journey. The plane was looking real tired. Really no qualms about it other than the rest of the passengers who are rude and taking the crews for granted.

Only at KUL-LGK flight the same 737 they do not serve meal because it is a short 55 minutes flight but you do get small refreshments which is good enough to me.

However the tray table is the bulkhead variety and is flimsy. The table slopes towards the left hand side when loaded. This is a problem when eating during turbulence as any liquid will almost certainly slide off the tray - this happened to me! The seat area is very draughty and cold - maybe just the bad flight I was on. The distance between the seat and the window is large meaning several pillows are required to bridge the gap (and support your head). I do not recommend paying extra for this seat unless you are over 6 foot tall and will benefit from the leg room.

The seating was so bad that it really should not be allowed and I actually hold the airline licensing and accreditation bodies responsible for allowing this to happen.

The amenities have been down-graded since then, but over all, I have found the staff on all my flights to be excellent. I agree that the cost for PE has increased over the years, but if you keep your eye out for flight deals from Qantas and their partners, then the higher price compared to normal economy is not double.

PTV is stowed in the right armrest and can be used comfortably in conjunction with the tray table. IFE system is fast and responsive and had a good selection of shows and latest releases. A word of caution however is to check the aircraft operating your flight as the PTVs and IFE system was older on my return leg to JNB. Fewer options a more outdated UI and a disappointing experience. Almost all movies had Chinese and/or English subtitles - which for me was a deal breaker and resulted in me rather reading a book.

In the dark they trip over your feet. 35J has the same legroom and as the space leads to nowhere you do not get other passengers stumbling over you. The huge downside to these seats is the almost absence of overhead bin space for your stuff.

I found myself shifting my weight constantly just trying to keep my backside from falling asleep. The other issue concerns the foot rest on the PE seats it is irrelevant for anyone over 5 feet tall. Basically it is useless and difficult to fully extend even if you wanted to use it. As far as ingress and egress from the window seat get to know your neighbor really fast since you will need to get up and move around many time during the flight just to keep your sanity.

Seat 26K slightly awkward to get past 26J to the isle but not impossible. When the seat in front reclined still plenty of personal space. Seat 24K was an exit row seat with exceptional leg room but a lack of places to put things. The other problem with this seat is the window is slightly behind you so instead of looking forward and out you look directly to the side making it a bit uncomfortable to look out.', \"We travelled in the 'green' section and in seats 38 DEF which were at the back of the section with a wall behind us. My wife and I travelled with our 5 year old. The flight was QF2 from Dubai to Sydney. We liked row 38. The seat reclined fully no one kicked the back of our seats and we did not have to be concerned shout reclining into someone's lap. In addition there was some space behind the seat to put blankets etc. The aircraft had large storage bins which took our hand baggage with no issues The seat location meant that we were close to a choice of toilets and also the self serve food area The cabin staff were excellent - friendly attentive and coming round on a regular basis with drinks and goodies (m&m's etc). The quality of the food was very good as was the range of drinks available. There was plenty to eat onboard and the self service area was topped up with goodies. Also Qantas serve good coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows. There were never any queues for the toilets and we were not bothered by any noise from the nearby galley. However the seat is no where as comfortable as Emirates and although the IFE is good it us not a patch on Emirates The legroom is ok but when the seat in front reclines it reclines right into your lap making a long journey very uncomfortable. On a 13+ hour flight! there were no goodie / activity bags given out to our 5 year old and the choice of children's movies was quite limited. On our first leg a Emirates flight my daughter thought Santa was on the plane due to the huge amount of stuff she was given. We had a lot of turbulence and no warnings etc from the captain. On the Emirates leg the captain warned us in advance and then after some heavy bumps came on and reassured everyone that all was well. If I had the choice I would chose the Emirates A380 over Quantas' A380 on a long flight purely due to the much more comfortable seat better IFE and great goodies for kiddies. Thus outweighs (for us) our experience that Qantas have more friendly and attentive cabin crew. If we were to fly on the Qantas A380 it would be in the same seats or upstairs (review of our return trip to come).\", 'Generally comfortable but the legroom was a little tight. Handset for the screen conveniently stowed in armrest. I did not experience any discomfort at all during the flight and enjoyed it.', 'Melbourne to London. The seat pitch was such that my shins kept hitting the seat in front. As soon as I reclined I had a complaint from the passenger behind that her screen was too close to her face.

Attendants on the flight from Sydney to Santiago were great but on return they were perfunctory at best and barely acknowledged us as they \"threw\" food etc our way. They disappeared for hours on end and unlike other airlines where stewards wander the aisles offering snacks etc throughout the flight you have to buzz and wait. It almost seemed an imposition to call them.', 'YSSY-SCEL crew were very kind and attentive the food that was served was extremely delicious and the entertainment was top notch recline and width could be better but It is economy class after all so I cannot have asked for a better flight.', 'I was on a flight from Melbourne Australia to Hong Kong on A333. I would say the overall journey was quite comfortable as two-third of the seats were empty and I was able to move around.

When paying an honest fare you expect honest comfort not to be penned in like cattle and whoever designed the seats for Qantas seriously needs further education in ergonomics.', 'This was the worst economy class seat I have had the misfortune to be seated in.

It turned out to be the worst seat I have encountered in over 20 years of long-haul flying. The problem was that there was a box-like structure containing who knows what mechanism immediately under the seat in front of me which meant that I had leg room in the most literal sense - room for one leg! Fine for children or those missing a left leg lousy for anyone else. (I might add that I had more leg room on my 40 minute connecting flight to Canberra in Economy on a 737-800 than for the 12+ hours flight from London to Singapore.)

Biggest problem - we did not sleep well.

(probably not going to happen?)\", \"LAX to Sydney. The economy A380 seats are a disgrace. The backs are thinner making every movement and touch from behind felt immediately. The seats recline beautifully - except the lovely recline means you are lying in someone's lap and someone is probably lying in your lap. This makes sitting up and reading impossible if the person in front of you goes to sleep before you do. The entertainment screen is also too close to see clearly as soon the seat in front of you is reclined. Lucky for me the gentleman in front of me was asked to raise his seat back so I could eat. The seats themselves are barely wide enough to sit in. There is less leg room than any other flight I have been on in my life. To eat requires the capacity to keep one's arms glued to one's sides while wielding a fork and knife so one is not elbow jousting with the neighbor. The tray table is so small it barely fits the tiny food tray which is all of about 9 x 5 inches. The entertainment screen remote is tucked away in the arm between the seats so you have to ask the person next to you to move his arm to retrieve it. Then you have to slam the armrest lid down on the attached cord without breaking it. I just kept the remote out and hanging off the edge of my seat so I did not have to bother that poor guy again. The armrests also do not raise all the way so if you are fortunate enough to have an empty seat next to you you cannot get rid of it and stretch out a bit more or rest your head against the next seat.I weigh 100 lbs/about 47 kg. I am thin and not tall. This seat was uncomfortable for me. Now imagine what it is like for any normal human.

However Qantas are changing the configuration of the A380 and these seats will be come part of a multi row economy cabin on the upper deck. Getting in and out of these seats is a doddle. The recline is great. and the seat comfy. My only disappointment was that the leg rest did not extend far enough.

I had fly Qantas again but their new tie up with Emirates means my route does not have any easy option anymore.', 'This review is for economy seat 48A which is an exit seat if it were a normal seat it would be much lower score (London-Singapore-Melbourne). I think this is one of the best seats to get in economy. You are the last to board and the first to get off. The seat is a window seat so you have the storage thing on the wall to your left to put things in where as if you were 48B or 48C you would have no where. It has part of the door sticking out in front of your left leg so if your over 6\\'0 you cannot really stretch your leg out fully. I am 6\\'4 and did not have a problem with this as you can angle both legs to one side and not obstruct the person to your right and it was intrusive either.. and the best thing is this seat only cost $25 to book compared to the $160-180 they charge for the other extra leg room seats/exit seats (including the two next to you). People say the seats are bad and in August I said this myself I felt they were too hard but for some reason it was fine this time almost like the cushions have been replaced and I really enjoyed the ride. If flying on an A380 with 31\" or less leg room like Qantas you will want to book a better seat as passengers behind you have no room and can hardly see the TV\\'s quite ridiculous. The seats recline too much. I think a better foot rest would be better than 2\" extra recline.', 'I was seated in seat 70G. row 70 is 3x3x3 and is the only row in economy that is like this. The leg rests are unusable recline is good and the seat moves as well as the back to improve comfort Overall the seats were pretty good.', 'This is the second flight I have taken with Qatar Airways from Edinburgh to Cape Town. I found this the best airline I have travelled with, I travel wheelchair assistance and found the staff friendly and very helpful. The aircraft is lovely and TV screen good, leg room good, food good, and the fresh coffee was the best - I would give them 5 stars.', 'Excellent comfortable seats. I actually slept the whole flight which I have failed to do on other airlines.', 'I have just completed 8 flights with Qantas and half of them including the B747 were like torture. I am quite tall and cannot afford to buy the extra-legroom seats. I joined their frequent flyer programme in the hope of getting aisle seats but that did not work. These flights were the tightest for legroom of any of the very many airlines I have used. Knees hard up against the seat in front with no chance of any movement - even worse when the seat in front recliners. On an 8 or 13 hour flight it is hardly bearable. Will not fly with them again.', \"Flew LAX to SYD on A380 seat 56H aisle seat. Get to my seat and find that something is wrong with my earphone jack so only get sound in 1 ear. The armrest does not raise up completely so no one can lean on each other. The leg room itself was okay but nothing fantastic. I am 6'5 tall and no matter what it is never going to be great I worked out how to move my legs to get maximum space. Flight attendants poor performance by fussing over pseudo celebrities on the flight and not caring much for anyone else. Will avoid Qantas if possible in the future. Disappointing experience.\", \"Traveled with my husband and son on the A380 flying from SYD - LAX return using the A380 both ways flying economy. Very poor seats on the A380. They were hard and not comfortable at all. The seat width was the same width as the Virgin Australia domestic plane and the leg rest was almost impossible to use if the person in front of you reclined their seat. And once they do recline you cannot get your bag from off the floor and it is almost impossible to get out of your chair. It's almost as bad as flying the domestic Qantas planes.\", 'Comfortable seat, decent legroom, good inflight entertainment screen. The only let-down was that the armrests could only be raised to about 60 degrees.', 'The seat is comfortable because has a support for the head. The pitch is good, comfortable for the legs. The best is the screen in each seat, big with many movies, musics, series, tv shows, etc.', 'Very narrow seats, flew out on QR2 and it was full and felt claustrophobic even though I was in the aisle. Came back on the A330 and seats were much wider. Qatar Airways are very good,just do not fly on their 787.', 'QANTAS promotes the A380 as their flagship what a bitter disappointment the service and food quality was good economy class seating was cramped cushioning comfortable and reasonably supportive there was no additional room to store reading matter Ipad or glasses. The entertainment system was excellent. Getting from the window seat to the aisle required the other 2 passengers to move from their seats to be stuck in this situation for 12 hours is inhuman the plane was fully occupied. In future I will become more selective in choosing the carrier who provides the best seat pitch on long haul flights.', 'Seat 35a I am tall 6\\'3\" and long-legged so it is vital I not only have enough legroom but that the seat supports me - I am also reasonably skinny so cannot take a hard seat. There are no exit seats on Qantas 747 Premium Economy only regular seats bulkhead seats and seats with back to bulkhead. 35a is the window seat second row in - I have to say the legroom is terrific no risk of banging my knees - also I could fully stretch my legs under the seat in front which I would not have been able to do with the bulkhead seat And the recline is very good though I believe less so if your seat backs onto the bulkhead (row 37). Only downside is you share loos with Economy. Noise cancelling headphones are good but the AVOD system is looking dated - A380 is much better. Foot rest is useless for taller people - they would be better off having an additional bar to flip out under the seat in front. Seat width is more than adequate for me being a narrow girth. It is not business class - you have to pay alot more for that - but you do get treated more individually than in economy - and Premium Economy being a small cabin it feels more individual - Qantas get a big thumbs up from me for the overall experience.', 'DOH-PHL economy on B777-200LR. Excellent seats comparable to the ones in Emirates A380.', 'I was looking forward to a comfortable ride since the 787 is a new aircraft and Qatar Airways is a quality airline. I had very little space for my feet and had to sit in an uncomfortable position to fit. Also the reading lights were pointed at you and not on your newspaper which made reading in the dark impossible. I will not book a flight with Qatar Airways 787 again. The connecting flight I had with Qatar Airways A380 was a pure dream by comparison!', \"Perth-London return the 777 for 3 of the 4 flights. 37A and then 28C and 27C. I think the seat size on all was generous - probably the widest I have sat in. The recline is incredible not good though if you want to sit upright and the one in front reclines! I was lucky to have no one next to me on 2 of the 4 flights so plenty of room. Also feet room was good (no box) could stretch right out. Only thing that bugged me was the touch screen. Didn't work well on both return flights. had to end up trying to navigate with the touch pad. a tad frustrating. Would book again.\", 'Hong Kong to Melbourne with no TV unit at all. I was told nothing could be done about it. Nine hours of sitting in a seat with nothing to do. The attendants kept offering me drinks which I thought was odd especially after they advise to keep alcohol consumption to a minimum. What made it worse was that I paid extra for the seat I was in a total waste of money.', 'The most comfortable economy flight I have had. The 787 is much less comfortable. But on both aircraft the staff provided exceptional service. This is my new favourite economy airline. I had been a Qantas devotee but this surpasses it by miles.', 'Qatar Airways A380 Doha to Paris 26 Nov 2014. Economy seat 31G (upper deck). In their brand new A380 Qatar Airways made the excellent choice to keep some economy seats in the upper deck frequent flyers will appreciate. The seat offers a generous 32x185 dimension in a quiet 2x4x2 configuration. TV screen wifi (fee) USB plug AC power for smartphone (AC power was not working). Service excellent with Qatar Airways crew outstanding.', 'Colombo to Doha a five hour flight en route to London and the leg room was similar to a budget airline.', 'The seats are tight in Coach/Economy although the added touches already on your seat when boarding were nice - blanket and pillow as well as headphones and a toothbrush. The Q- Snack care package given to passengers is a nice touch in case one gets a little hungry in between meals. My tv did not work and although there were a couple of open seats 21 rows back I chose not to move seats and before we landed at LAX the First Attendant/Purser visited my seat and gave me some gifts and an apology for the inconvenience; I thought that was quite generous of him.', 'Sydney to London on the A380 paid $20 extra to get an exit row seat in order to get extra leg room (seat 66D) as I am over 6ft 2 tall. My main issue with the seats are that there was hardly any thickness to the bottom cushion of the seat so this made for a numbing 23.5 hours so much so that I was hardly able to sleep at all during the entire flight. I estimate that there was approximately only 2.5 inches of padding between the top to the mesh metal base of the seat. The B747 on the outgoing leg of the journey was a lot more bearable. Whoever gave these seats a Design Award must have had no sense feeling from the waist down or actually sat in them for a very short period of time. The only reason why I would recommend this seat would be for the extra leg room apart from that it is a very uncomfortable experience.', 'Avoid to travel with this type of airplane from Qatar airways fleet. The Qatar Airways Boeing 777 or A330 are more comfortable.', 'The economy seat reclines a bit further than many others. Not a good thing for the passenger behind who either has their tv screen far too close to their face or anything on their table is dumped into their lap when the seat is reclined. It happened to 2 people on my flight and very nearly to me.', \"One of the best economy class seats I know. I am 5'9'' and legroom was more than enough. Recline was better than most airlines. Screen had a pretty wide adjustment angle so I had no problem to watch the program regardless of how reclined was the seat in front of me. At the meal time there was enough room to use the tray table without the passenger in front putting their seat in the upright position. Good choice of entertainment. the only downside was that the seat was a little hard. Summing it up a very good overall experience.\", 'Manchester - Doha - Singapore. The A330 was quite comfortable enough legroom. The B787 seats are narrow and too close together you struggle to get in and out of them. The entertainment box situated under the seat restricts your legroom by about 1/3rd.', 'Once the passenger in front reclined his seat fully it was in my face and I had difficulty getting up from my seat or moving let alone trying to collect my bag from under the front seat which was impossible. My husband moved to a free seat beside him which gave me 2 but as seats are concave and armrest does not push up fully out of the way was impossible for me to take advance of 2 seats on a 13hr night flight. The new A380 seating has me now looking to other airline options for long international flights.', 'I fly to and from London from Melbourne about 10 times a year and try to fly premium economy or business as much as I can. With the introduction of the A380 I expected Qantas to improve seating in both cabins. Unfortunately not. The Premium Economy seat is OK but why would Qantas decide it should be at the back of the upper deck? There is very limited overhead storage especially for people with full size roll on bags. Being at the back on the plane there is far more lateral movement and it is very noticeable so in comparison to the 747 Premium economy I found myself less comfortable due to the bumping around had to shunt by carry on luggage in a different location to where I was and we were one of the later ones off the plane meaning a longer wait in the dreaded passport control. The food was pretty ordinary as well. I can never understand that these flights are always full yet Qantas bleats about struggling to make ends meet and keeps dropping the quality of services.', \"I am a short guy and the experience was unbearable for me. The seats are slim without much foam for back support. The legroom is impeached by the entertainment box attached to the seat with make seating straight impossible even for my short legs. The aisle seat's inconvenience are the entertainment box and the reduced aisle which will provide you a bumpy ride from other passing passengers or carts. If you think the middle seat is your saver. When you recline the seat is move forward which turn your knee as an entertainment tv stand. I would advise that you fly Qatar Airways Airbus or Boeing 777 where comfort is very satisfactory.\", 'That was one of the best you could ever get on a long-haul flight. I was worrying about the seat before the flight because I am 5\\'9\" and a quite heavy weight. But once I got seated there was still space between me and the bar and the legrooms were still lots left.', 'Cramped economy seat made particularly uncomfortable as entertainment system takes up considerable space in the foot well. Have to sit with legs at an angle to avoid the box. Exceptionally uncomfortable flight.', 'Qatar B777 long haul MEL-DOH experience was good. One of the better economy seats plus good service. However the new B787 (DOH-BRU return) horrible. Main problem is the entertainment system box which intrudes into legroom for A C D F G and K seat. It occupies about one third of the space directly in front of the seat. On one sector the middle seat was empty so sitting on an angle made it almost tolerable but on the return the middle seat was occupied and I had to squeeze my foot between the seat support and the curved sidewall. Other Qatar flights maybe but if it involves a connection in DOH to a 787 forget it.', 'Seated in 80A from MEL-SIN fantastic leg room as no seat in front of you and not an exit row so you do not have to pay for it. Family member was sitting in 80B and for economy seat this was pretty standard compared to other airlines besides for the fact there is a net to place you feet in under the seat in front. This makes it feel you have more leg room and is pretty comfortable. When seats recline the whole seat moves with you including the bottom part so this makes the seat seem to recline a bit more.', 'This Boeing 787 has the narrowest seats I have seen in some time. Be prepared to knock your elbows with your co-passenger or if they are of large built they will spill over in your seat. Compared to the A330 seats of Qatar these are a nightmare. The leg room is also not good and once the person in front of you reclines you are done for.', \"This is the best economy seat class. Took 2 flights from Muscat to Heathrow (transit in Doha) and I was still feel as fresh as ever when landed in T3. The seat is big enough for me and the leg room still has some space (I'm 5'8 btw). The food and cabin crew were superb.\", 'Extremely comfortable for economy. We really appreciated the kit (socks eye-mask earplugs toothbrush/paste). Food was above average for economy. Best of all was the in-flight entertainment system. Very large screens and a huge choice of films games tv shows.', 'The entertainment system was easier to use on this aircraft. The seats were very comfortable and had great legroom. Easy to access the seat and I will fly Qatar again!', 'The leg room on this plane was what stood out for me. The seat was a bit hard but you get a pillow and a blanket to compensate. The in-flight entertainment had many recent films of different genres to choose from good amount of seat width and a good seat recline. The food served in my opinion was fantastic with usually an asian option or western dish. The bigger windows on the 787 were amazing you get a fantastic view whilst not compromising the view of the other passengers.', 'BWN-DXB-LHR-DXB-BWN a long 17.5 hour flight the entertainment was a little bit outdated. But the seat I liked but it is very hard to get in or out from the seat so I recommend you to seat not next to the window.', 'I had my first opportunity to fly this A380 operated by Qantas from Sydney to Singapore (approx 9hrs flight). The legroom was not enough and width of the seat was ridiculous as well.', \"BNE-HKG. Had row 23j/k to myself. Excellent legroom in the bulkhead although having the divider meant no stretching out. Seat width suffered due to the tray tables being in the armrest - PTV's were fold out type which I prefer to seat back.\", 'SYD-LAX Premium Economy seated in 34K. The amount of room in this bulkhead seat was excellent along with the ability to stretch out on the side lockers that every seat has on the top deck of the aircraft. Excellent AVOD and meals. For the 13hour+ flight premium economy is worthwhile as the is the extra cost over economy but is considerably cheaper than business.', 'The Dreamliner had a lot of legroom and a fantastic entertainment system. The seats were comfortable and the headrest was fully adjustable. Generous recline also!', 'Great seat comfort amongst all other middle east carriers. good food courteous staff. overall it was a relaxing journey from Lagos - Doha - Delhi. The bus transfers at Doha International airport are really tiring and wish something done about it on an urgent basis. The remote control for the in flight entertainment system was bit outdated and hard to use.', 'I was very comfortable onboard. I was able to charge my phone via USB on the tv screen. However I did have to place the pillow underneath me as the seat was a little hard.', 'Whilst not five star it was nevertheless a seat one could live with or in.', 'The person in the seat in front had their seat reclined in my face the entire night from Dubai to Brunei consequently I had no choice as to repositioning my legs and the TV screen was now back in my face - uncomfortably claustrophobic. Moving to a standing position to squeeze out to go to the toilet was most awkward to say the least.', 'The seat was broken. The TV screen did not work the lady in front reclined her seat jamming me in my seat. I could not put down the meal tray. An awful 3.5 hours red eye flight from Brisbane to Auckland. Beware cheap flight deals.', 'Premium economy was excellent as I have a leg problem - only thing I had the back seat with a protruding wall to the left and could not get out when the seat it front was reclined and had to wake the passenger up. Return journey was better but still had difficulty getting out with the seat in front reclined. I did notice the second row from back had a larger space in front.', \"LAX-SYD in seat 51K. It's a bulkhead seat at the front of economy which means extra leg room. Was able to move my hand luggage bag to the floor to use as a foot rest which meant it was easier to sleep. It was easy to get out due to the extra leg room. Quick exit at the destination.\", 'While the legroom is not fantastic the seats are comfortable enough and the recline is nice. Certainly enough room for the short 3 hour flight that we took.', 'Comfortable seats with lots of legroom. Qatar Airways entertainment system is real easy to handle.', 'Qatar Airways service and food are a cut above most airlines. Boeing 787 the plane was not super clean the seats are kind of narrow especially with the IFE box at your feet. I think Qatar should explore installing a Premium Economy seat for people like me who cannot necessarily afford Business class but are happy to pay a little extra for a humane amount of space on long haul flights.', 'Row 58 at the back best seats I reckon with these last couple of rows only 2 wide meaning easy access when you want out for the loo plus a little quieter down here as well - there are no toilets down the back. PTV screen a bit small.', 'Flew to HKG from KCH via BWN on a mixture of A319 and A320. These RBA workhorses are beginning to show their age. Seats are very stiff and headrest keeps sliding down. Legroom and width was generous but not very comfortable to sleep in. Entertainment was the means of drop down screens. Got a stiff neck from trying to follow the movie. Food and service was excellent. Too Bad the seats were somewhat stiff.', 'Madrid to Doha on Boeing 777-300ER. We got seats 28A/B/C/D. The food was fantastic and the crew on this flight was really friendly and young. The seat was really confortable and relaxing. Oryx Entertainment- system was really good. The only annoying thing on this flight was the menu. Instead of giving us a menu on paper they stopped the entertaining system and they put the menu on the screen. And after about 15 minutes you could use the entertaining system again.', 'LHR-DOH-BKK. My wife and I have travelled in aircraft with the same seat pitch (34\") before but never one so wide in economy (18.9\"). I am 6\\' 4\" tall and this was my most comfortable long haul flight ever. The ability to pre-book a row of just two seats was a bonus and made access even easier.', 'I believed that when Qantas advertised changes in the Economy seating they were not clear in advertising it was only for the Premium Economy Seats. I found that the A380 was an uncomfortable flight as when the person in front reclines you are left hardly any leg room also found that the trays were smaller the toilets smaller. I would never fly with Qantas again as I found the ground staff rude and unhelpful when we complained that they had not put our party of 4 together they had even placed the two teenage girls in our party next to a young man which the ground staff explained that they could not make any seating changes we were lucky the flight crew were able to arrange other seating arrangements.', 'LHR-HKG and got upgraded to Premium Economy both ways and even with an Economy Class service it was very good. Seats very spacious especially as I am a big person. IFE had a great choice and easily to reach as in the side armrest. Recline was very good and let me sleep 8 hours straight on the return journey. Luckily I had row 35 both ways which was good as row 36 is missing a window.', \"I am 186 cm tall and I found the seats on QR's A320 really comfortable. Leg room is generous and the seats recline well.

Had phoned through and paid for exit row seat on this flight and it was well worth the $160 AUD. The customer service officer on the phone said I had be happy with this seat as the flight had been reconfigured. Was not too sure what she meant until I boarded and realised I had a premium economy seat. These seats are very comfortable and I enjoyed the extra seat width and elbow room. Service was fantastic and because we were seated directly behind P/E the drinks cart was not too far away. The seat itself is nice good recline (compared to regular economy) and not knocking elbows is good. TV and table all located in arm rests and easily accessible. As I had the window side of the seats there is the ability to squeeze shoes pillow between seat and wall. Only let down is lack of storage so accessing books/magazines or toiletries I needed to access the locker each time.', \"I am a 6'2 broad guy and normally find airline seats uncomfortable and restricting on my knees - however Qatar economy seats are the best I have found yet comfortable and with enough space to stretch my legs out.\", \"Premium Economy LHR-SYD-LHR A380. I had my eye on 38J and K (exit row rear right of the cabin) and managed to get them there and back. This gave us (me + wife) masses of legroom so that was not an issue. Recline is OK and we managed a decent amount of sleep though it still felt like airline sleep rather than truly restful sleep. Food was ordinary in truth though nicely served on linen china etc. Staff were excellent on three of the four legs. We were addressed by name on several occasions by smiling crew. On SYD-SIN leg the Customer Services Manager walked around and met everyone in the cabin shook hands and thanked us for flying with Qantas -then repeated this as we approached SIN! Premium Economy cabin is quite close to the tail so lateral movement is quite noticeable during turbulence. IFE is first-class; touch- screen intuitive interface and loads of choice. First time I have taken more than a passing interest. Only disappointment was that the screen has to be stowed during take-off and landing - precisely when the Skycam in the tail is at its most entertaining so you cannot watch that part of the proceedings. And finally beware - while these two seats are the best in the cabin for legroom they are also the chilliest. This may be because they are near the galley which has to be cooled or it may be that it is next to the door - though I cannot believe this would be the cause of a draught! In any case it was much warmer a few rows forward and we had to cover up well in the excellent blankets to avoid the worst of it and still there was an uncomfortably cool draught on our faces. This was true on both trips (both A380s but different aircraft). So while I had recommend Premium Economy I am not sure this is the best place to sit. The ultimate measure is that my wife suffered a lot less from her usual terminal jetlag (we've done this trip quite a lot) and said she would do it again which is not true of 'standard' Economy (there's no going back to Economy now).\", 'Melbourne to London with Qantas and thought that as part of the One World Alliance and a BA Club card holder I would be allowed to choose my seat online - but was not to be. I requested an emergency exit seat with more legroom only to be told that I would have to pay an additional AU$160! However the services desk informed me that if I wanted an exit seat and sat by the window I would not have to pay anything at all - given that there was the section over the door sticking out which would result in my legs being slight angled but not in the way of the passenger next to me. Well worth it and saved me the money and I would recommend anyone wish for more legroom.

If no one else pays for and reserves an exit row seat you may be th eonly person sitting in the exit row even if the rest of the aircraft is packed. Exit row seats are not assigned to regular passengers. The leg room is great which compensates from the fact that none of the seats on Ryanair recline which is a good thing in that you never have the seat in front of you pressed against your face or run the risk of a passenger in front pushing back their seat while you are eating a meal or when you have a drink on the drop-down tray and it ends up on your lap.

I did this for four adults and explained that my father and I both had mobility issues and needed extra legroom. Once on the plane, we found that our boarding passes led us to the center four seats with no extra legroom. This occurred on both of the roundtrip segments. When I complained at the time of seating, I was told that the plane was full and the only extra leg space would have been the exit row, which we (understandably) were not eligible to sit it with disabilities.

The recline worked well and slid forwards as well as backwards - great sleep support though a tad more recline would have been great. I never usually manage more than 2-3 hours of constant shut eye on an airplane, but I managed to nod off for 6 hrs straight in this economy seat. Given the 3x3x3 config, the aisles were fairly large too. If I had to crib, it would be the small'ish size of the TV screen, the lack of AC power (USB was available) and how tight the seat pocket flap was!\", 'New York-Jeddah-Islamabad. Flight was full. Nice clean aircraft food just average. They have an open self service snack bar in the rear of the aircraft. sandwiches juices soda and fruit like banana apples and peaches. At Jeddah we had a 10 hours layover. Had to haggle with the staff at the airport for the dinner vouchers. Only reason I will fly this airline again is its low price.', \"In this old aircraft they have configured the upper deck to be Y class - hence the 3x3 configuration. Narrow width and pitch. No PTV's. Old interior and limited amenities.\", 'In this small regional aircraft it was a pleasant experience. The seats were dark/light blue and leather that gave a nice feel.', 'Took SilkAir again from SIN-SUB and SUB-SIN on MI225/226. The new WIFI Inflight entertainment was very nice and there is a booklet to tell us how to connect and it is helpful - although you may be confused for first time user. They also played shows on the overhead screens (without sounds though). Seat was comfortable and with good recline and plenty of legroom for tall people.', 'Took Silkair for the first time from HAN-SIN on MI653. Before the aircraft took off the FA walked down the aisle with wet towels which was pleasant. After the seat belt signs were off the FA came around for drinks - water beer or orange juice. I was trying out their new WIFI inflight entertainment and encountered some problems but the FA was very helpful and helped troubleshoot the problem and I got my entertainment on my phone! They also played shows on the overhead screens (without sounds though). Food was good. After meals the FA came around with coffee/tea and another round of drinks before landing. Although the flight was slightly delayed it was a pleasant journey and I would fly with them again.', 'Very nice seat, you were able to move the cushion back and forth and not only the backrest. Did not see any power outlets other than the USB, but was not in need for it. However the iPod function does not work as I hoped, it picked random songs from the phone, no AirPlay.', 'The cabin was a bit worn out, Singapore Airlines is currently retrofitting all of its 777 and my flight was just the \"wrong\" plane. They will soon introduce Premium Economy on the route to Sydney, so getting a retrofitted plane will be a safe bet on this route starting in middle of August.', 'Los Angeles to Tokyo. The legroom and footrest were really comfortable. For dinner, I had the pork chop, which was the best airline food I have had. On the tv, they had many selections of music, movies, shows and much more. The service was also excellent.', 'Large leg room. On the 2nd deck, there is even a personal side compartment for passengers to store their personal belongings. Comfortable seats with neck support and ample room to move every once in awhile.', \"I love Singapore Airlines - however having flown twice out of Melbourne I do not understand why they out such an old aircraft on this route. Sub standard seating and entertainment and the plane looks shabby. Flying out of Singapore is a different story - newer aircraft and a completely different flying experience. Saying that, Singapore Airlines service is fabulous and they do a lot with the Y class product - just wish they flew newer aircraft out of Melbourne! What's with people who recline seats in economy?\", 'HKG-SIN flight was great. The amount of legroom was good for me and the IFE was fantastic. The seats were great, comfortable and could recline decently. Service could be better as they looked tired. Overall, it is a great airline to fly with!', 'Singapore-Surabaya. The seat is very comfortable and the seat is well-cushioned and enough leg room for tall people. The entertainment is very good with latest movies and good flight map information provided.', 'Leather headrest wings were very comfortable indeed. Excellent amount of space in the overhead lockers. Good seat pitch. Folding tray table designed cleverly. Only drawback is lack of touchscreen functionality on VOD, which required using the handset whose buttons had begun to lose their responsiveness. Overall a great economy class seat.', 'Access to aisle was not very accessible. The in-flight entertainment would make up for it.', 'Seats have the least legroom I have ever experienced. Clearly designed for short people. The in-seat TVs are a good size but controls confusing. They need touch screen.', 'The seat is very comfortable and the seat is well-cushioned and enough leg room for tall-people. As the flight is from Tokyo to LAX so the temperature is very high for non-Japanese. Wide selection for PTV and catering is very good and they have a good Japanese bento for inflight meal.', 'SIA must have some of the smallest economy seats in the sky! I have had better ones in budget airlines. Very uncomfortable narrow and not enough leg room. The only thing going for it was the size of the monitor.', 'B777-200ER: Economy Class. (BOM-SIN). Comfortable seats with quite satisfactory leg room. Recline angles need improvement as the seats must recline to comfort during long haul flights which seems to be missing.', 'These seats were very uncomfortable. They did not seem to have any padding and were really hard. I had back trouble for a week after both trips London/Singapore Singapore/London. The head rests were also uncomfortable. I travelled on the A380 in March 2012 and that one was better. A number of passengers were saying the same thing. Apart from that the plane felt very spacious and the service wonderful.', 'The A380 economy seat even in the $50 surcharged premium seats are fitted with very thin cushions to save weight. They are ok for a short flight of 1-2 hours but not at all comfortable for 13 hours long haul.', 'Singapore-Male. The seat is quite comfortable with wide space. The entertainment is excellent with latest movies and music I can keep track where I am by flight information. The food is good not good as Malaysia Airlines but the attitude of the crew when they serve you meals is excellent.', 'First of all if you are planning on flying the A380 with SQ I would suggest you get in early and book an upper deck seat. The cabin is much quieter than the main deck making it easier to sleep etc on long trips. The aircraft appeared to be new and was very clean and tidy inside. As for the seating itself economy class is not as comfortable as I expected with the seats feeling somewhat smaller and more cramped then the cozy older generation seats in the SQ B777-200 that flies from Singapore to Manila. The entertainment system food customer service however were all excellent on all my SQ flights. Being a rather small asian framed person I think it would be quite difficult for a 6ft European to travel long distances in the SQ A380 economy class but I doubt any other carriers would offer anything better without having to pay for business class. In terms of seat width legroom and access these seats felt no better than the Jetstar A330 that also flies Melbourne-Singapore. All in all I would probably take SQ again on my next business trip to Asia given their competitive pricing at the moment (SQ is at least $300 cheaper than Philippine Airlines when travelling between Aus and Phil). Changi airport is always a pleasure to use and as mentioned before the customer service with SQ is very good on and off the aircraft.', 'I was pleasantly surprised at the level of comfort of the cattle class seating. I was travelling with my wife and we were fortunate enough to have a row of 3 seats to ourselves on both legs of the flight. While this allowed us a deal more comfort I have not factored this into this review. My score is based on the overall comfort of a single seat. The A380 is a very comfortable and quiet aircraft service of cabin staff was exceptional food was good however the entertainment selection onboard was perhaps not as varied as I had expected.', 'We were put in the downstairs cabin - real cattle class. When the person in front reclined their seat when I was eating the tray hit my stomach. I am not a big person. Screen was so close to my eyes it gave me a headache after less than an hour. Getting out was a real challenge even though I had an aisle seat. There was no room to stand upright or even close to upright so I was at an angle of 45 deg and had to support my weight on one arm. Very disappointed.', 'I do not get it. The best plane and they come up with the single worst most uncomfortable seats ever. Not sure what they were thinking but next holiday we are going Qatar Airways simply for the comfort factor.', 'Frankfurt-Singapore return. Very hard seat on upper deck poor recline very uncomfortable impossible to sleep.', 'Singapore Airlines split my family up despite booking several months in advance for a round trip from Heathrow to Singapore. The plane is quiet and food was quite good too. I thought the seating was poor because it is obviously designed with no thought to Westerners that are tall or full bodied and seat legroom is worse than other airlines. The service from the cabin crew was clinical and without a smile most of the time. In future I will not use Singapore Airlines.', 'I got the last seat on the plane furthest back. Avoid this seat at all cost - no seat recline at all! Conclusion unless you are in first or business class go somewhere else and do not pay a premium for a company which in fact does not provide you any extra service / experience.', \"Similar to some earlier comments the seats were really hard unlike SQ's 777-300ER that I normally flew. The only advantage of flying this A380 is you notice less noise on the cabin. The mood lighting was not that great because it was set only to red and orange LED all the time. My seat was on the upper deck with less seats and less people. I think it is always better to choose such seats. Being seated at the last two rows nearby the toilet (82E) might not be really pleasant due to the smell.\", 'The new SQ seats are hard. I fly regularly the SIN-Paris leg on Economy and after 5-6 hours my rear is just numb I have to get up to let the blood flow. Not only is the seat hard but the extremely limited incline of the backrest only allows your back to rest in a technically still sitting position. And that is hard for a 12-13 hour journey. I do not understand how SQ could have gotten this part so wrong.', 'B777-300ER AKL-SIN and B777-200ER SIN-DEL. The 777-200 Economy Class seat was nice and square shaped meaning that it was not narrow like the new Singapore Airlines Economy Class. And it had more leg room and better lumbar support. I think the older Economy Class is much better than the new one.', 'Fell far short of the standards expected on Singapore Airlines. Two weeks later my knees still ache.', 'I prebook my seat Row 42 or 43 as I use the toilets frequently due to a medical condition. I always find that the seats are solid yet not uncomfortable. Plenty of luggage storage above the seat and accessibility easy too. Egress from the seat is easy and the service is second to none.', 'Being small I find the width of the seat quite uncomfortable. Did not recline my seat because of children seated behind. Once the seat in front is reclined the space is even more restricted and stepping out of your seat proved more challenging. If I can help it will not fly on A330 but unfortunately it is the kind of aircraft that SQ flies for the Taipei route.', 'The 747 is an old product I find the seats small compared to the newer 777 by SQ. I like the arm rests folds up and I managed to lie flat over 4 seats.', 'Avoid at all costs seats 37A/B and 38A/B. Row 36 in economy is reserved for families with babies and so row 36 on the left side of the aircraft is shifted back several cm. As a result row 37 and row 38 have much much less legroom. My knees were pressing into the seat back of row 36 for the entire trip (14+ hours) and the situation was made much worse by the fact that the person seated in 36A jammed the seat all the way back as far as she could giving me even less leg room. My seat mate was a large tall gentlemen and he suffered far more than I did. For both of us the seats in row 37 were claustrophobic. Couple that with the fact that both seats in row 36 have boxes under them that restrict the amount of room people in row 37 have to stretch their legs and you have got the recipe for a very uncomfortable ride.', \"The padding was thin and I needed to use the pillow as a lumbar support. The combination slide-forward/recline is a good compromise that limits intruding into someone's space when reclining your seat. I wish they would have stuck with the 34 inch pitch found on their 777-200's. Those extra two inches really do make a difference.\", 'Mediocre seat. Flew from JFK to JNB. Very little legroom but good recline.', 'Very comfortable seat very large leg room good food good choice of entertainment and very hospitable crew. Definitely is a must fly!', 'The seat was slightly harder than I remember but was still comfortable the entertainment system was one of the best I have ever seen with large screens. They also had three meal options as opposed to two. If you are looking for a good low cost carrier definitely fly SAA!', \"The flight attendants were very kind and the food was good but the seats were like sitting on a rock. It was extremely cramped and I found it extremely difficult to sleep during the flight. I am of a small stature and even I felt cramped. The in-flight pillows and blanket were scratchy. Their Boeing 777-300ER's are slightly better. If you ever go in economy sit on the in-flight pillows to create blood flow but use your own pillow or a jacket for your head if you are going to try to sleep on the flight.\", 'Cramped narrow hard seats made even more constricted by having the AVOD remote in the side of the armrest. After 2 hours of our MEL-SIN flight both my wife & I were uncomfortable & I resorted to sitting on my pillow for the remainder of the flight. Awkward to get out of during he flight due to the tight seat pitch.', \"Seat was okay got the bulkhead which was very good meant a good deal to have extra legroom. SAA's food still comes up tops servings very generous as is the drink. (Nice to see the amarula as a South African). There was no inseat entertainment.\", 'Economy class from Frankfurt to Johannesburg return. We were traveling with 4 people and seated in the middle row. I found the seats to be comfortable the recline was ok. Even with the person in front of me reclined there was still enough room to move about and to get in and out of your seat easily. I enjoyed about 6 hours of sleep during the flight.', 'As a PPS Solitaire member that flies extensively all over the world in all classes I can say that the service has declined within the last 18 years. Find the new A380 economy seats incredibly hard and uncomfortable with poor pitch and lousy legroom for long journeys far prefer the old seats. SQ heats the cabin more than comfortably. Seem to offer the same food for the same route month after month after month. Far too popular so no longer can get choice of seats better value for money out there.', \"I am 6'4 which is the only reason I am giving the seat a fair rating. It was at least as good as I expected and if I had not had my kids with me I could have gone for a preferred seat at a very low extra of $50.Be prepared to do lots of sideway sitting and stretching if you are 6' plus. SQ experience more than compensated for any legroom shortage though.\", 'Upper Deck : Paid extra to book 71A & C which have no seats in front of them. While this is good there is limited (a small locker usually filled with blankets or other equipment) to no overhead storage and you either have to place your cabin bags in lockers further back (making them difficult to retrieve inflight and on landing) or hope the crew will place them in the crew cupboard in the bulkhead area (some are happy to and some are not!). There is no window at these seats and also no side storage bins. Most significantly the seats are next to the bulkhead section where the baby bassinets are located (there were one or more screaming babies on each leg!). It may be advisable to go with similar seats further back where you may only have people milling around waiting for the toilets.', 'Had seat 59K (last row window). I found the B777 seats more comfortable (width and padding) than those of the A380. With no seat behind you can put the seat back at any time without worrying about others behind you. The bulkhead section nearby houses a galley (no toilets) and while there is some noise it tends only to be noticeable at meal service times. As the last 2 rows are only 2-abreast there is only one person to get past when getting out of your seat (I tend to prefer a window on longhaul as I have a broad upper body and so always tend to get bumped into by passersby on the aisle).', 'A380 LHR SIN and return. Upper Deck Seats 71 A and C. These are \"preferred\" seats and need to be booked in advance on the SIA website for a charge of $50 per sector. Well worth the extra as there is no one in front of you and the emergency exit does not intrude from the side (as it does on a 747). I think these are actually better that the exit seats further back on the upper deck as no one came up and stood in front of us on either flight whereas further back people milled around waiting for the toilet. The toilets next to our seats were for business class and curtained off so no one came to look out of the window from there. Seat was OK on the outward journey but felt quite hard and was somewhat uncomfortable towards the end of the return flight (This was probably because I had already sat on a 777-200ER for 10 hours with very hard seats!). Flight felt quite hot on the way back (although there were several people with blankets and jumpers so it may just have been me. I did discover 2 fresh air vents around the emergency exit door which improved matters considerably so it is worth looking for these. A380 noticably quieter that the 777. Food and service excellent as was the AVOD. I woulld certainly choose this airline/aircraft/seat in the future if at all possible.', 'The economy class seats on the A380 are extremely hard - almost unbearably so for a long haul flight. Based on the hardness of the seats alone I would not fly on this aircraft again. We paid an extra charge to sit at the front of the upper deck economy cabin - do not waste your money - the aircraft windows are not aligned to these seats there is no side storage bin no above storage making it inconvenient to store items for take off and landing and no footrests. The only advantage is it is easier to get up from your seat. Service was not great for Singapore Airlines - and the hard seat - awful!', 'The footrest makes it hard to stretch your feet out underneath the seat in front of you also there is a bar underneath the seat in front of you making it hard to get your legs comfortable.', 'SIA 777-200ER SIN-AKL and CHC-SIN (all the SAI 777-200 planes to New Zealand are the ER type). Seat pitch was good. The problem was the hardness of the seat and a ridge running accross it. The padding was very thin at the back and probably old and compressed (I pulled the seat cushion up to have a look) and there is a pneumatic cushion at the front of the seat so that you can change the thigh support (via a small button on the front left of the seat cushion operating a valve. There is also a similar pneumatic lumbar support). The problem was firstly the hardness of the seat and secondly the junction between the foam and this pneumatic cushion which caused a ridge that cut into my upper thighs. The overall result is a very uncomfortable seat. Both flights had the full AVOD system which was nice and service was good (but not as good as on the A380) as was the food. The seat would not put me off flying SIA again as the A380 was good and staying overnight at Changi was excellent (40 minutes from aircraft arriving at the gate to checking in at the airport hotel and fantastic and incredibly cheap food at the food court on B2 level) but in future I had try to fly on the 777-300ER which I believe has the same seats as the A380.', 'Flight in Y class SIN-PER was a miserable experience for 5 hours on the A330-300. The seat pitch was impossible for a tall person like myself.', 'MEL-SIN and SIN-MEL A380 service. I found the aircraft cabin to be very clean and spacious and the service standard very good. The first sector was on the main deck seat 48K (window) 3x4x3 and the next seat on the upper deck 74K (window) 2x4x2. The seats were well designed and ergonomic however the seat cushion was extremely hard probably the worst I have experienced on a longhaul flight. After two hours I was in pain and had to stand up. The seats have foot rests but these are almost useless for a tall person and when those in front are fully reclined it it almost impossible to get out without the people beside you getting up. The upper deck seating configuration in economy is generally much more pleasant typical of A330/A340 cabins.', \"SIA's economy class seat on their B747-400 looks very elegant-with useful adjustable head- rests.

On the return flight there was a box in my legroom underneath the seat in front which took half of my legroom.

I complained shortly after we left Sao Paulo but the Purser was not able and to my impression not willing to find a remedy. Admittedly the economy class was full but business was not.

The reclining seat is hardly reclining and is one of the worst seats ever experienced on any airline. The 15 hour flight was most uncomfortable and sorry after 30 years flying UA cannot recommend this plane. If UA do not amend their seating am afraid many loyal UA flyers will seek alternative airlines to the USA.', 'One of the worst flights I have ever flown. I had to endure 12+hours of this \"misery\" from\" Tokyo Narita to Chicago. Food was not very good and the comfort level was horrible. I strongly recommend not flying on a United 747.', 'ORD-YVR. Like others have mentioned the new seats are awful very hard and uncomfortable on any flight over an hour. Leg room was great but after almost 4 hours in this seat it got painful. We all want cheap flights but someone must be able to design a less painful cheap seat. Also flew a 757 from Dublin that day seats were far more comfortable in that plane', '(Newark-Berlin Tegel) 7.5 hour flight was emptier than most United flights. The food was very poor and the seats were very bad. The flight was bad.', 'I do not know why United even bothers to provide seats at this point. Also the sizes of the seatbelts are arbitrary. I was in the one seat row going into Newark and there was about an inch gap between the buckle and the insertion side. I was unable to maneuver it because when I tried to I hit my head so I asked for an extender. While in Newark I became ill and did not eat for two days. When I boarded the plane to return I was on the side with two seats. The buckle went as far as my naval. The side you insert came as far as the side of my leg. You probably think I weigh 400 pounds. Nowhere near. My heart really goes out to others - I do not know how they coped. I am never taking United again. They disrespect people. All they care about is how many people they can stuff into their horrible planes.', 'The new United seats are terrible. While they look sleek and modern there are extremely uncomfortable for any duration of flight. I have status with Air Canada but fly United while in the States. United made a mistake investing in these seats because it is only going to push business travelers and new travelers away. With the flexibility to choose airlines in the USA I would strongly urge United to not invest any more money into this bad idea. Shift investment to another style seat that all travelers in business or economy would feel more comfortable in. Just a suggestion but I think all would agree.', 'I fly over 35k miles per year with united they upgraded some seats on certain planes and they are the most uncomfortable seats on any airline I fly very hard slippery material so you keep sliding down and I believe they also shortened the length of the seats so more of your thigh is hangout my off.. Terrible investment United!', \"I flew on United Airlines for the first time and it was the worst experience. I am a 6' in shape lean guy and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. The tray table was impossible and sitting in the those horrible seats made me feel like i was crammed into a sardine box as I was constantly touching the two people on both sides. On the way back to Norway it was in impossible to sleep as I could not recline back enough to find a comfortable position.\", 'I had the most painful 6.5 hour flight from Newark Liberty to SeaTac due to these horrible seats. Everything about them is wrong. The seat bottom is too short the seat back is slumped or slouched even when fully upright and forces short-legged passengers to plant their feet into the floor to keep their hips from sliding forward and grinding their tailbones into the seat. The backs recline too far back to be practical in such an absurdly tight-packed cabin and will interfere with use of tray tables and hurt the knees of tall passengers unfortunate enough to sit behind a reclined seat. The armrests are far too low to be useful at all and dig into the thighs of virtually any average-sized adult. These seats are good only for illegal forms of \"enhanced interrogation\" and nothing else; three days after this flight I am still sore and have small bruises from the crap armrest digging into my leg. I will do anything to avoid this terrible flight in the future. A general rule for those looking for good seats: Avoid 737s altogether especially the 800/900 series since those planes tend to be utterly crammed to the gills. It\\'s just getting worse all the time.', 'Due to a full flight and I was upgraded to economy plus seat without paying a dime. The seat is very hard and uncomfortable. The width of seat and legroom are pretty the same as other airlines in us. I am assigned a middle seat which is so uncomfortable and I cannot move around and this is so tiny. But this is cheap flying HK to SIN with meal and assigned seat and baggage and the best timing for this shuttle flight. I would suggest to take Asian airlines.', 'Being a Former Star Alliance airline, I expected the seating to be a lot more than it was. The seats had the same feeling as a ride in a taxi with that easy to clean material on the seat. The Recline was okay, there was no power outlet which really ticked me off on the A319, as my phone was dying. Legroom was mediocre and the width and aisle space was standard. My bag was forced to be Gate Checked on the 319 as there was in adequate storage onboard. I didnt have my Carry On Bag during my layover in Philly which was disappointing as I had a change of clothes incase it was humid ( which it very much was ).', 'Flew PHL to TLV. Seats would not recline more than a couple of inches. Impossible to fall asleep on the 10 hours flight. Would not fly this route again on the Airbus 330.', 'We were completely outraged that we paid non-refundable fees of $320 over and above the airfare on our Philadelphia - Lisbon roundtrip flight ($79 per person each way) for \"choice\" seats - and found out that these seats do not provide any extra legroom. We made the reasonable assumption that IF a passenger pays that much extra they would receive what other airlines provide - several inches of additional legroom. We did not click through to the description US Airways gives that does say no extra legroom is provided. But again paying that much more we made the reasonable assumption that we would receive something more than sitting in the first 3 rows of economy with no additional legroom. We fault US Airways for a very misleading offering. We will try very hard to avoid flying with them again for this reason! P.S. other passengers in the \"choice\" seats were also outraged upon discovering their seats were no less cramped than other economy seats!', 'I agree with a previous reviewer who said these seats were \"torture devices.\" About 2 hours into a flight from Charlotte NC to Phoenix AZ my body was screaming to get out of the seat. My poor husband who is quite tall was miserable as well. This was one flight I could not wait to get off of it was that bad. The seat was hard and confining; the leg room stingy. The guy behind me continuously hit my seat back doing what I do not know. The woman in front of me used her seat back to bounce back and forth throughout the entire flight. Why? Because they just did not have enough room. The space they allot you in your seat is pitiful and painful. Twice I had the cart hit my knee as it was pushed by and several times I had people brush up against me as they walked past because there is so little room in the aisle. Why is this acceptable for air travel? By the time we got off the plane my husband\\'s feet and ankles were severely swollen and he does not normally have a problem with ankle/feet swelling. Really kind of scary the physical abuse you have to tolerate in order to fly from one part of the country to the other. I cannot imagine flying on a plane like this on an international flight. It would be intolerable unless you are built like an 8 year-old.', 'This was by far the most uncomfortable flight that I have been on and I was in one of the worst possible seats 35C. Row 35 has three off-center seats relative to the four seats of row 34. Between the brackets of the seat in front of you and boxes that hold life jackets there is no place to put your feet. There was a universal camaraderie in the cabin in suffering passengers of all shapes and sizes. People ignored the seat belt signs and milled about the cabin for periods of relief. I will never fly US Airways again for international travel.', 'Airways A320 from Philadelphia to Phoenix and there was more room. I am not that tall at 5\\' 8\" but I had recommend avoiding the US Airways A330.', 'Very uncomfortable seat for a transatlantic fight. AV could not be rated since it and the reading light were not available for the complete flight.', \"Very uncomfortable prayed the passenger in front did not recline his seat. For health's sake do not use this airline for transatlantic flights.\", 'US Airways has two versions of the A330 the A330-300 used on many European routes out of PHL and the A330-200. The A330-300 version manages to cram in 30 more seats than the A330-200. A330-300 Economy seat 25E - hands down the most uncomfortable airplane seat I have ever sat in. GI basically had to sit with my knees and legs bent sideways the entire 8 hour flight. Overhead bins barely seem to hold an average sized rollerbag. Return on A330-200 version which had much more room I could actually sit properly in the seat!', 'The seats are torture devices. I was fortunate enough to sit in an exit row (seat 23C) on CLT- FCO but since there was no passageway or galley behind the bulkhead passengers kept climbing across our row (and our legs!) during the entire flight. My heart went out to everyone else not sitting in the exit row - it is astonishing how little space there is with these seats.', 'This pertains to seat 8B on the A330-200 as I think the center section of 4 seats and perhaps the rear section may not offer as much width. Seat width was an excellent 18.5\" which greatly aided in comfort even though pitch was only 31\". I thought the equipment box under 8a was not overly intrusive and much better than on Continental\\'s B737\\'s. I found the seat width great the TV screen quality very good and the food good-enough. Overall a pleasant economy seat.', 'There was so little leg room that I could not fit without bumping the seat in front of me. And I am only 5\\'8\" tall 150 lbs. There was not even room for a small purse by my feet because of the box they had fitted underneath for the live vests. The passenger in front of me could not recline because my knees dug into his back. It is criminal that they think this is acceptable on a transatlantic 10 hour flight. Do not buy a ticket on their airline until they take out two rows from their configuration.', 'For an 8 hour flight from FRA to CLT the seat was unacceptable (admittedly I am 6\\'7\" tall). Ground staff was extremely unhelpful regarding a seat change and I was forced to spend an additional $500 to buy an upgrade to Business Class. The seat is an insult to passengers.', 'Flight from Philadelphia to Manchester UK. Have flown to and from USA over 25 times. This by far was the worst flight for comfort and leg room. The internal flight from Boston to Philadelphia has acres more legroom and space. Do not fly transatlantic with US Airways if you want to fly in comfort.', 'Add one more to the list of those who find USAirways A330 coach class seats incredibly uncomfortable. As others have also stated this was puzzling because our Denver to Philadelphia leg on an A320 was fine. I was shocked that our international leg to London offered worse comfort than the domestic leg. Makes no sense. I should point out that I am the type who almost never complains about anything and can usually cope with discomfort or inconvenience. I am also relatively tall at 6\\'/0\" but not unusually so yet all the way to London I had to sit at an angle. It was impossible for me to fit with my knees pointed straight ahead. It was not close either. I had to sit at about a 30 degree angle to one side then switch to the other side ad nauseum. By the time we arrived I was in serious pain and discomfort. I have never experienced seats this close together on any flight anywhere!', \"By far the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced. We went 1 leg on an Airbus 320 - that was great. Last leg on the 757 - that was horrendous. I am only 6' tall but my knees hit the seat in front of me the entire trip. There was so little room between that seat and mine that I was not able to use the lap tray for my computer. The distance between adjacent seats was minimal so buckling seat belts was an arduous task. This plane is probably fine for 1 hour flights but on 7-8 hour flights it is horrible. This plane is billed as 188 passenger; it needs to be about 150 to give people an opportunity to relax on their flight.\", 'Danang to Saigon (Ho Chi Minh) was operated by an A330-300 leased from China Airlines. Economy seats were about 33\" pitch with foot rests which lower from the seat in front of you and personal seat back video.', 'Not being particularly tall nor large I found the seats to be fine for a cross country flight. I guess if you are 6\\'5\" and/or a large person then the seats particularly the middle may be not so comfortable. Of course you will have similar issues regardless of airline.', 'The leg room is barely enough to clear your knees from the seat in front of you. The seat reclines about 2 degrees at the most. There is a TV you can watch but it is so close to your face that you are better off turning it off.', \"It's been a while since I have flown with Virgin, and was rather surprised by the changes. I purchased the extra legroom seats and was glad I did. The standard economy looked horribly claustrophobic, and premium economy did not look much more roomy than the seats I had booked. However, they did look more comfortable as the new seats feel as if someone forgot to put the padding in. However service excellent, and the hot meals I had were not bad. However, the breakfast was a bit disappointing - a yogurt, granola and a mini muffin. The afternoon tea (a wrap and a biscuit) was good.\", 'Used seats 78c and 77c which are upstairs, and seats are too close together. Going out I had all three seats to myself, I sat at the window seat and found it extremely difficult to get out - the seats in front are far too close - but I was lucky the other two seats were vacant. On the return the plane was full, and as I expected one has to get out of your seat to let the two people next to you get out.On a positive note the service was excellent and food good, probably because there are less seats upstairs. But I will not be flying Virgin again unless they upgrade to newer planes.', 'Very fresh and new looking seats of purple leather. Ample room in both width and leg room for a short internal flight. Seat is more comfortable than a lot of long haul airlines. Slight recline pitch but for an internal flight it is more than enough.', 'Premium Economy to and from Cuba Seat 18C on flights VS63 and VS64. Cabin service on the outward leg was good and attentive (we were told there was a supervisor on board) but I was surprised that the space around the seats was extremely confined and that the in-flight Ã¢\\x80\\x9centertainmentÃ¢\\x80\\x9d did not work. The distorted sound from the headset made watching any film impossible and the touch-screen system did not allow one to follow even the flight map. Food was just about edible (in spite of what the menu cards promised). It was served in cardboard containers but bedecked with linen tray cloths and a set of cumbersome metal cutlery. The return was another story. On boarding we were warned that alcohol service would be restricted as the outbound flight had virtually drunk the plane dry. Personally I did not find this a problem on a night flight. However cabin service this time was sparse to say the least. With the dinner bread rolls were not offered beyond the first two rows and there was no chance of refilling the miniscule Ã¢\\x80\\x9cchinaÃ¢\\x80\\x9d coffee cup. The much-vaunted liqueur service turned out to be a glass of brandy - no choice. Sleep was impossible. The seats had obviously been designed for a greater pitch than had been afforded. If the person in front employed the Ã¢\\x80\\x93limited- possibilities for reclining their seat the surrounding design ensured that you were trapped in yours. If you used the footrest your knees almost hit your chin. Breakfast was similarly awful. I am relieved to say that being at the front of the queue for boarding and disembarkation did have its advantages but I feel obliged to report to others that I regard the Premium Economy service that we received a vast waste of money. One would do far better to purchase extra leg-room seats in Economy Class and investigate taking some of the excellent locally-available snacks to sustain one on the journey. To say this service is over-hyped is an enormous understatement. We are contemplating another visit to Cuba but are giving serious consideration to extending our journey time and using Dutch or German carriers.', 'My Wife and I are villa owners in Florida and travel back and forth on Virgin Atlantic two & three times per year. In the past five years my wife and I have seen a major decline in the poor quality of service and the introduction of the new cramped seat in Premium seats. We have just returned from Orlando to Gatwick on 25th April 15. What we experienced was cramped seats touching my knees when the passenger in front reclines tired rude staff my audio jack in my seat was broken so I could not watch a film. Overheated dried out food. We were seated upstairs towards the front on P Economy with 40+ economy seats behind full of loud unruly children and parents. The crew were also handing out free champagne to the upstairs economy even though they had not paid for this service. I feel that Thomson Airways new B787 Premium Economy is leaps ahead in quality/cost and comfort compared to Virgin Atlantic and I have already booked my return flights with Thomson in August 2015 to return to the US.', 'I just arrived in London on VS602 from Johannesburg. These are the worst T economy long haul seats one could ever have the misfortune to encounter. The pitch is supposedly 31\" but I bet it is less. When someone reclines their seat the video screen is literally in your face. The top back of the seat curves inwards putting your upper back and neck in a very uncomfortable position. The minute I sat down in this seat I felt uncomfortable. This is an 11 hour flight and these seats are not even suitable for a few minutes. My back is sore now. I am an average height male 1.8m and weigh 80kg. Yes I am not a small child but I have flown most other long haul carriers in economy and none were ever this cramped and uncomfortable. It is really a shame because cabin staff were good and the food acceptable for economy. But the thought of spending another second in those torture devices fills me with dread. I will avoid VA economy long haul at all costs. I am so sorry I did not book with another airline.', 'I am 5.10 and I had no leg room on an 11 hour flight - extremely uncomfortable. The staff were fine the in flight entertainment was fine the food was ok for economy but the seat itself was horrible and I will not fly Virgin economy again. My connecting Aer Lingus flight from Dublin to London had more room than my 11 hour Virgin flight from London to Shanghai!', 'After Premium Economy from LGW to Barbados (BGI) and back again felt that the extra money was worth it. Glass of bubbly before takeoff with significantly better seats than Economy in terms of width and space in front. Even when the seat in front had fully reclined it did not bang into my knees and I could adjust the PTV angle to continue viewing. Aperitif meal with drink and a digestif made for a better service. Service was excellent with the benefit of having fewer passengers to serve. On the night flight returning we were on the last row before the partition and could fully recline for sleep. I am not tall (5\\'9\") but fairly bulky but felt absolutely comfortable in the seat. Will definitely book this class again based on my experience.', 'I am 6\\'3\" and 16 stone and found the seat very comfortable Having flown economy on the way to New York I found the upgrade on the way back to be well worth the money. the staff on the plane were very friendly and very professional. Have used Virgin before and will most defiantly use in the future.', 'After having flown Air NZ premium economy from Auckland to San Francisco we were incredibly disappointed in Virgins premium offering by comparison. We flew from Vegas to Gatwick and chose to pay for the upgrade as we wanted more space more service and to feel rested on arrival. There is no lounge access the seats are cramped the service was pretty ordinary - and we felt very disappointed. If this is premium I shudder to think how small the economy seats are. I am not a big person and whilst I could stretch my legs out - the reclined seat in front of me made it almost impossible for me to get in and out. You definitely want an aisle seat - I was in a middle seat. The head rests move when you try to put your head weight against them. I think you would be much better off paying for more legroom and extra luggage in economy if available - it would be cheaper and much the same result. The seats are definitely wider than standard - which was the only really positive thing I can say about it. They even charge you if you want more sparkling wine in the flight - hardly a premium service. Got virtually no sleep.', \"I am really shocked with Virgin Atlantic's standard to say they have slipped is putting it mildly. I think I would go far as to say they are one of the worst transatlantic air lies I have even flown and I fly a lot! The seats were terrible so uncomfortable and you were shoe horned into a tiny space for 11 hours. The food was awful borderline inedible and the staff were ok. Just ok not fantastic service but not awful. TV offerings were not great pretty disappointing especially their offerings for children. The children's food was again inedible meaning my 7 and 4 year old had nothing to eat the entire journey as they did not even have child snacks for kids like crisps or popcorn. With all the schedule changes (our flight was changed by 3 hours) they did nothing to accommodate us when we complained. In fact their customer service agents at their call centre were down right rude and had no clue. I have to say they are turning into the new Ryanair - nothing to be proud of Virgin Atlantic!\", 'We flew from Hong Kong to London Heathrow on 19/02/15. This was a 13 hour flight. We were shocked when we boarded the plane and discovered how small and restricted the seats were and how they was virtually no leg room. I am only a 5\\'4\" tall female and I had a panic attack when i sat down in my seat next to where the window should be- there was no window I could look out of just the fuselage. I cannot describe just how restricted the seat was- it was the sort of seat you would expect to sit in on a budget airline short haul flight not a supposedly reputable airline\\'s long haul flight. The chairs in front were practically on top of us and our chairs hardly reclined so needless to say we did not get any sleep. We had no idea how small these seats would be. Passengers then tried to go and sit in the empty extra legroom seats as the plane was taxiing towards the runway and some minor disputes occurred. The cabin crew did not have a handle on the situation and to our surprise concentrated on taking extra payment from these customers so they could sit in these seats with apparently extra legroom instead of directing them to return to their seats whilst the plane was moving! Overall this was the worst flight we have ever flown on and we are sorely disappointed that Virgin\\'s standards have plummeted. They are clearly only interested in money making and have no regard for their passenger\\'s comfort or for attracting repeat business.', 'Flew from Miami to Heathrow on 15th February. This was the worst flight I have ever been on. We paid for extra leg room seats. Yes we had extra leg room but as the extra leg room was also the queuing area for the main toilets my feet were constantly trod on and I had to keep my feet tucked tightly into the seat. The four main toilets were about two feet from my seat. They were constantly in use and many times the users would open the door before flushing the toilet. The smell was awful. There was a curtain to block my direct view into the toilets but staff kept it open even after I had asked if it would be closed during sleeping time. Many people coming out of the toilets used my seat head rest to hold on to and elbows were inches from my head. There was nowhere to put personal belongings. I was handed a meal tray and then I had to pull a very old tray from the side of the seat to place it on and then told I must fasten my seat belt .This was a task requiring many hands. The staff were off hand and spent a lot of time chatting .First and last time on Virgin Atlantic.', \"VS201 - Hong Kong to London - 7th Feb 2015. As another commentator has stated here there is something about these premium economy seats making them just not that comfortable. Perhaps it is the low placement of the foot rest limited recline fatigued cushioning or the adjustable headrest 'wings' which give way as soon as a head rests upon them. An additional issue is the placement of toilets on this plane none of which are in the premium economy section which might be an inconvenience if the plane is full resulting in more demand and a longer occupancy of the aisles by cabin crew performing their duties. I guess the extra fare does not equate to a proportionally improved flying experience. Cabin crew were excellent.\", 'We spent around GBP300 each to come back overnight from Barbados to Gatwick in Premium Economy seats 22HK and 23HK. None of us got a wink of sleep on this 8+ hour flight. Not sure why but these seats which I found very comfortable on a day flight with a little recline just do not seem all that comfortable when fully reclined at night. I could still get in and out of the seat OK with the ones in front fully reclined but I could not get to sleep.', 'Day flight to Barbados from Gatwick 16H & K (downstairs). Very pleasant comfortable flight. Good food and service. Cost around GBP200 extra each.

Come on Virgin this day and age you can not repair your website for more than a month when tried to call to reserve seats on phone some very unfriendly and unhelpful agent could not find suitable seats for us. I have been your frequent flyer for sometime your overall services are getting worse. Not again will I choose Virgin.', 'Most uncomfortable flight I have ever had from Johannesburg to Heathrow. Am dreading flight home will never travel Virgin again. Sad considering I have always rated this airline highly but they have now obviously rated profits higher than passenger comfort!', 'London Heathrow to Hong Kong and back- most uncomfortable flights I have ever experienced. While in China I used a no of Chinese airlines (eg China Southern) and in every case the legroom and comfort was superior to Virgin Atlantic. If you are of average size or more avoid Virgin like the plague.', 'On our return flight Orlando to London Gatwick we prebooked 4 economy seats on the upper deck. No mention was made to us when checking in that our seats had been switched for 4 centre seats one row from the back of the plane. When we complained we were told firstly it was a light flight and we had been moved to spread the load more evenly but would be able to move to vacant seats once plane had taken off. On the actual flight the captain advised that having received a number of complaints that the upper deck was not being used due to a broken lift. Whatever the reason we had a very uncomfortable flight siting so close to the toilets and subjected to both the toilet smells every time the door opened and people queuing to use the toilet all night. On top of this we were last to receive any food and by this time there was only turkey left and we had no choice of menu by the time service reached us. The final straw was being left with my uncollected breakfast tray despite twice having requested it is removal until a few minutes before we landed when it was finally taken of me. I will not be flying virgin again.', 'I have always chosen virgin in all my international travels but this will be the last time. In the past I have always been able to reach below my seat and have been able to view the TV screen without any problem. However on this trip San Francisco to London I had to contort my body to reach down to he limited space. I could not even fit my small purse and shoes under the seat in front of me without it spilling out to my foot space. When the person in front of me leaned back his seat there was no way for me to view the screen without bending down. If I needed to use the toilet I had to use acrobat skills to even get out of my seat. This was by far the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on. The only good part was the service. I feel as though in the past 3 years virgin has seriously gone downhill in quality. As a result they have unfortunately lost my service with it.', 'We enjoyed our flight with Virgin Atlantic plenty of room we did purchase two seat plus seats and this worked very well for us with a 3yr old. The cabin crew were very friendly and happy they served us well and the food was very good.', 'Holiday to Florida flight experience was horrendous both out and back from back to Gatwick. There was no leg room or space to get in and out of seats. I was travelling with my family of 4 with 2 children we were devastated at the experience and will never fly Virgin again.', 'Return flight from Newark to Heathrow. Virgin Atlantic changed our seat numbers to accommodate a family which is fair enough families should sit together. The seats we were allocated were awful behind the bulkhead seats - D&E. The family immediately reclined their seats and had no consideration for others. It was difficult to see the screen due to the close proximity it was extremely uncomfortable we struggled to get out of the seats due to the recline. Virgin should have put some thought into the fact that we were inconvenienced but they could not care less. I feel let down by Virgin and will probably shop around with other airlines in the future. Another annoying factor was that we were in the second to last cabin and there was no hot food choice by the time the cabin staff reached us. Overall a very poor service.', \"We paid extra for premium economy seats as a treat from london gatwick to las vegas. I have always been a huge virgin fan but this will be the last time we fly with them. The seats are not that comfy although wide. An hour into the flight the couple in front of us fully reclined their seats. There was so room and myself and my 6 foot 6 husband had to sit with our legs at 90 degrees for the rest of the flight. I could not even get out to go to the loo there was such little space and spilled drink over myself in the process. It was extremely claustrophobic. I was hoping the return journey would be better but the audio did not work to my entertainment screen. The flight attendant offered me a portable DVD player which i had to balance on my tray in an already cramped space. I flew virgin premium economy a few years ago and in my opinion they have placed more seats in the area to fit more people in as i do not remember feeling that cramped before. On a positive note all the flight attendants looked polished but i'm they have now lost my custom to Emirates or BA.\", 'Seats are narrow with little legroom. If person in front reclines you have zero legroom. Food was absolutely horrendous. Service was \"going through the motions.\" Seems like VA is cutting back on service just focusing on premier class. This will be our last Virgin flight for a while maybe forever', \"Far from ideal economy seats for a long haul flight - you book Virgin with the expectation of getting something a little better but this is definitely not true anymore with economy. Very modest incline on the seat certainly no where close to feeling like a natural sleeping position. Just about enough leg room for me as a 5'8 tall man but in some seats the seat mounting will stop you being able to stretch out. Food was average - standard meal tray with a cold starter (pasta salad) rubbery bread roll and a small hot element (either lasagna or chicken) which reminded me of a cheap ready meal. Second meal was a cold snack consisting of a very small sandwich and a very small packet of premium crisps. Other than that got one hot and one cold drink service with and just after the main meal. Our plane had being recently refitted so the new touch screen entertainment system was in place and I have to say this was excellent with a very good selection of recent films and TV. Very small screen but this did not matter so much in economy as you are never too far away from the seat in front! Other than that the cabin in the 747 was starting to show its age which I guess was not surprising considering it has being flying since 2001. I would not go out of my way to book Virgin again.\", \"LGW-LAS. Priority boarding and an alcoholic beverage served as soon as you were seated. The seat is wide comfy and there is plenty of leg room to stretch out. The recline is lovely too because it really does enable you to doze off at will. The food that was served was perfectly fine and filling. IFE is superb. It caters for all tastes and after your meal and just a little too much to drink you can drift off into one of Hollywood's latest offerings something from TV a game of football or catch up on the latest news. Premium economy reviews should not make the mistake of comparing to business class it is not a flat bed. What it is though is a very comfortable seat with great service and fantastic IFE. It's so worth the extra money.\", 'Gatwick to Barbados on the 747 and had a very comfortable flight. The return flight on the A330 was a different story. I have never been so uncomfortable on a long haul flight. The seats are hard they do not recline very well and there is nothing to support your head when you want to sleep. On the 747 the head rests come round so you have something nice to lean on and the seats seemed more padded. The A330 seats were so hard not even my 7 year old got any sleep. The entertainment is okay but nothing to write home about and the food was pretty awful. I used to think Virgin were the best but having flown Emirates a few times Emirates are far superior. In future I will avoid flying Virgin.', 'We used the twilight check in service which was fast and efficient and made such a difference at check in the following day. No queues just straight through. We had upper deck premium economy seats (21A/C24H/K). Lots of room very comfy seats amazing choice of films/tv /games attentive staff wonderful food.', 'I felt too big for the seat due to narrow width. Both of my arms overlapped the armrests by about 2 inches. I could not tuck my leg under it without feeling a lot of compression on it. My shoulders had to be curled forward like a racecar as I could not flatten my shoulders completely. To exit the seat row I had to bend at a 45 degree angle. The cabin and seat was clearly ageing. The seat base was saggy and as the pocket was saggy it used up even more of the limited space. Tv buttons took a lot of effort to press due to wear and the screen was not properly aligned which meant I had to angle my head inwards about 30 degrees to be square on.', 'Flew LHR to Cape Town own. What is all the hype about Virgin. This was the worst flight ever. I fly regularly to South Africa. The seats were narrow and cramped. No legroom at all. Food was dreadful and very small portions. Offered a drink only once during flight. Aircrew not at all customer focused. Food almost thrown at you. No smiles please or how can I help. Also 2 stewards trousers and waist coats were threadbare and torn. What a disgrace to represent Virgin and Richard Branson. Will never fly Virgin again.', 'The most uncomfortable flight we have ever had. Very narrow seats no leg room if you are taller than 5ft and the pocket on the seat in front cuts into your knees. We were on seat 42 - avoid it at all costs it is next to the crew quarters - they are in and out all night opening and shutting the door talking and laughing - had no rest at all. We hope we never have to travel on this plane again.', 'People reclined so far in front they were almost on our laps. Awkward to get out of seats as not enough space. Arm rest in middle did not go fully back either which made things even more complicated. Very bad when you have arthritic problems.', 'LHR-SFO and LAX-LHR. We were disappointed to find our Economy seats were narrow uncomfortable and immediately claustrophobic. We waited 2 hours into the flight for a drink or even for any acknowledgement from cabin crew. The plane had already been delayed by 1.5 hours and we also spent 45 minutes waiting on the ground before we could take off so by that point we felt quite neglected really. The pilot did acknowledge why we had been delayed but stated there had been a Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmajor technical faultÃ¢\\x80\\x9d with the plane Ã¢\\x80\\x93In flight my partnerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s TV kept cutting out and in the end froze for the remains of the flight so he had to read instead. I had last flown with VA ten years ago and have memories of comfortable seats adequate leg room attentive staff and good food. I do not know what they have done but I felt they have economised on all the above areas. On the return flight to London the pilot was very pleasant and reassuring speaking to us on a few occasions and acknowledging turbulence. Also although the TVs are temperamental the selection available of films and programmes is excellent really. I agree with the person above who suggested that the emphasis is now on PE. However as I cannot afford to travel PE I would shop elsewhere in future to see if it is still possible to travel Economy in comfort.', 'SFO-LHR round trip. The seats were comfortable and FA attentive. For a long haul flight we totally recommend PE. great selection of movies. The food was adequate and the only this missing was a plug for your laptop or phone.', 'My husband and I flew premium economy from Cancun to LGW. It was a truly horrendous experience that I would not wish anyone to repeat. The legroom was fine until the person in front reclines their seat. I was left with no room for my legs and had to have them parted around the seat in front. The meal was served late lights out was only for a couple of hours (on an overnight flight) and nothing was done about people yelling and being rowdy during lights out. The food was so awful that I turned down the second meal. Seats can be booked 3 months in advance which is awful. We encountered several couples who were unable to sit together (including a honeymooning couple) because there were no seats left in pairs! A truly awful airline.', 'Mel-Syd. Economy seat 25A. As flight was near full having a window seat was a good choice. Seat width was wider than on an A320A330 or A340 and it was a welcome change not to feel so compressed in terms of the seat area and legroom. The downsides however were the constriction from the left side wall tapered inwards from shin to toe and headroom when standing to get out. Cabin felt dated despite the aircraft being younger than 5 years - this came about due to visible cracks in the plastic fittings as well as rather old looking mould on the seat in front and no tv screens anywhere.', 'Sat in seats 80H and 80K the last row of the upper cabin on a flight from London to San Francisco. Seats barely reclined because we were situated right in front of the bathroom. The seats were really hard to get in and out of especially once the person in front of me reclined her seat. Once that happened it was also difficult to see the TV screen in the seat back. Sitting near the bathroom was also bad because of the smell. I had avoid flying Virgin Atlantic economy for long haul flights at all costs. On the trip SFO to London we paid $50/seat extra for 3\" of extra legroom which was worth the money for such a long flight', 'The seats are narrow hard and very uncomfortable. Legroom is average but the seat pocket is in a position that it limits your space. This was the most uncomfortable seat I traveled in a very long time.', 'The flight was delayed by 6 hours the plane was a nice feel as it was new if someone reclines their seat it goes right up close to your face and the person that was in front of me reclined his seat from the second the seatbelt sign went off to the second the flight attendant had to tell him. The entertainment system was good touch screen and new technology (on the A330). A sorry would have been nice for the FA spilt the cup of tea when collecting my tray just one of the great features of my wonderful flight to London. The FA was more interested in her colleagues night out than unlocking the toilet after take off.', '13D (DAR-MEL) exit seat. LOADS of leg room but there are seats in front. Comfort is good but can feel not so on 4hr+ flights. Armrests seem quite weak do not stay upright if you want to lay down but you still can. Exit seats do not recline which is a pain. But if the plane is not full then its all good you can stretch out.', 'LAX-BNE. Premium Economy seats were very comfortable had ample leg room and the 3-position leg rest was really nice. The front row just gets a cushion for their feet after take-off. I prefer the leg rests the other rows have as they are adjustable. The recline was pretty generous and I did not feel too crowded when the seat in front of me was down. The seat width could have been a bit wider. I had some room but if you are a larger individual you will fill up the seat. With my seat reclined and my feet on the leg rest in the top position I was almost all the way stretched out. (I am 5\\'6\") I found it very comfortable. For 2 people the side rows are great. They are just two seats and we felt like it was our own little area. Getting out of the window seat was pretty good. The VOD system was pretty good. They had a seat-to-seat text chat feature and games you can play against other passengers. The movie selection was good. They provide noise-canceling headphones and they worked very well. Welcome drink menu for meals attentive crew and self-service bar is awesome! There was always water juice beer wine rum and soda available also bags of potato chips. The premium section also has it is own restrooms - large and clean. Welcome kit included eye cover blanket toothbrush socks etc. I was very impressed with Premium Economy and thought it was well worth it for a 16 hour flight.', 'LAX-BNE.

It seems people do not realise there is only so much space. I myself am 19 stone not something that I am proud of but I did not have any problem with getting in or getting out of my chair. Also the service that I received while on the aircraft was very good on both outward and returning back to the UK. I flew from LHR to LAX last October. I do not believe that I was just lucky. My last comment is if you do not like virgin then I wish you all the best on united.', \"The seat on virgin's 747 was uncomfortable to say the least. The armrests were miniscule and a TV remote would have been better. If the person in front of you is a total jerk and has no respect he/she can lean their seat all the way back and make it impossible to see your TV or even move. Getting into the seat is very difficult and you have to bump into the fellow passengers.\", 'SFO-Heathrow-SFO. Premium Economy seating was good. Leather seats that reclined. The flight to Heathrow was full crew was friendly and professional. The food was nice and the amenities wonderful. The crew on the flight to SFO were a bit more flustered even though premium economy was sparse. They seemed to forget about me on a few occasions (not asking if I wanted things taking away other things making sure I was in premium economy and not economy etc.). They were definitely flustered. As someone mentioned previously I also noticed the premium economy bathrooms were opened to all in economy though the business class bathrooms were off-limits to premium economy passengers. I would fly premium economy again as what I saw of the economy seats were awful.', 'The seats were so narrow that it was impossible to move without either switching on the light or calling the steward. Lack of cushioning on seats mean a numb behind after a few hours.', \"SYD to LAX return (return flight was seat 38F). Found legroom and recline on V Australia's 777 superior to others. Seat was a little thin/firm under backside and being 100kg I noticed. Seats are a good width but bloke next to me kept spreading himself out too much which made it difficult to sleep properly.\", \"On long haul flight from MEL-LAX the seat cushioning became intolerable. We did everything from placing pillows / blankets under our bottoms & thighs to regular position changes & walks around the cabin. What's the use of having the widest seats in economy across the pacific if they afford very little comfort in seat cushioning?\", \"I have travelled Virgin Atlantic for over fifteen years. I usually take between three and five flights a year with them. If the there was no loyalty scheme I would not fly with them anymore. Here's why - the seats in economy are small and have limited legroom (31 inches). They no longer offer any of the great benefits they used to. The amenity kit has gone and the meal has been reduced to its most basic form. Anyone who flew Virgin in the good old days would be amazed at what it is turned into. I have flown all three classes and the emphasis is now all about Premium and Upper. Virgin is all style over substance these days. It all looks amazing in their fancy commercials but the reality is that if you can only afford to fly economy they really do not care about you.\", 'These are by some distance the most uncomfortable seats I have ever endured in an aircraft. The seats are on the small and narrow side but the over-riding issue is how hard they are and the position they force your lower back into whether you recline your chair or not. After only 2 hours I was in pain. To put this in context I have taken flights lasting up to 15 hours and have never been moved to complain about my seat before. I will never fly Virgin again.', 'SFO-LHR-SFO. Old seeming plane Premium Economy was not worthwhile. No amenity pack on return. Filthy toilets but nice FAs. Pretty uncomfortable overall. Also Premium Economy toilets were avail to all Economy passengers.', 'Premium economy Las Vegas to Gatwick. Cabin staff good the rest of Virgin Atlantic do not give a damn after they have your money When you complain they just give you a corporate answer and brush you off with any of the excuses they have for each situation. You pre assign seats and rarely get what you ask for you ask why and they tell you its an aircraft change even though the layout is the same. They are untrustworthy. I have given them many chances but they keep letting me down.', 'I am slim but had to wedge myself into the seat. With the TV control in the side of the seat you have to get out of your seat to get it. Was so cramped that I did not bother getting up on the flight out or back which was unhealthy. Very uncomfortable. Virgin is now a budget airline without the budget prices.', 'Outward flight seat in Row 42 opposite crew door - which opens and closes all the time as they go for a \"rest\".

Once seat reclined slightly for sleeping it moves forward making legroom impossible. I am 5\\'2\" and knees were touching seat in front. Seats hard and uncomfortable. Will re-think using Virgin again. Slightly better outward on 747.', 'Nightmare in Row 31 centre aisle on night flight from Boston to Heathrow. Started trying to check-in and choose seats 24 hours before departure. Failed on all counts. Called London from hotel four times. Promise made to put note on Boston file but no record of call admitted by ground staff on our arrival at the airport. Row 31 is the first middle group of four seats behind the bulkhead separating Upper from Economy Class. My partner and I are not fat people but we could not fit ourselves comfortably into these extra narrow seats with airbags attached to the safety belts which were using up even more of the limited width. A kind young man offered me his exit seat as I suffer from arthritis in my hip. My partner was not so lucky. She spent the entire night flight with her arms crossed (as the passengers either side of her had taken both arm rests. Virgin Atlantic. Why does Virgin Atlantic online check in system not work and why are they offering four seats on a plane that even slim people cannot sit comfortably in?

Food terrible on way back - will not flying Virgin Atlantic again.', 'Seats feeling old tend to recline when leaning back even if switch button not held. Poor screen visibility especially if front seat reclined.', 'With the seat in front reclined it felt as claustrophobic as a budget airline at no time could I see the television properly even when seat in front upright. The staff were totally uninterested in the passengers. We will never fly Virgin again and found Premium Economy a rip off (we had paid almost double economy prices for what?)', 'Seat recline and leg room inadequate shins pressed up against seat in front.', 'I fly long haul regularly and found that the seats on Virgin Atlantic were the most narrowest seats I have ever been in.', \"I am only 5' 3'' and when the person in front reclined their seat fully my TV screen was too close to my face her seat invaded my personal space and had it not been a night flight I would have complained. Premium economy on Virgin A340's is not worth the money the space is too small when the person in front decides to recline their seat.\", 'If you have a larger than \"average\" body shape do not bother with Premium Economy - you will need upper class. Premium Economy seats have the controls for TV and audio built into the inside of the armrest so cannot be accessed if you are wedged into them. I was unfortunate enough to have a box under the seat in front so could not stretch out at all. My seat was far too narrow for me and I had to keep getting out of it during an 8 hours flight it made my journey horrendous. I upgraded on the return leg to upper class which cost an unacceptable amount but I felt that there was no option. It should be noted that the Premium Economy seating does not have moveable armrests and being fixed makes this worse. Economy seats do have some movement on the armrests but only to 3/4 posiiton.', 'London to Boston and for the first time upgraded to their premium economy - seats were comfortable and spacious. The downside on the return leg when the passenger in front of me fully reclined his seat for the entire flight which made my space feel encroached.', \"Virgin's Premium Economy seats are twice the price. What you get is more seat width legroom and recline better service some better food and booze. The problem is that the armrest between the seats takes up a lot of space and cannot be lifted up. So if you travel with kids or even a spouse there is a lost opportunity to get more comfortable. The kids cannot lie with their heads on your lap ever in premium economy. The seats recline more than economy but it does not matter. It's still not enough and the seats in general are quite uncomfortable.\", 'We were in basic economy on the flight out plane half empty so we were told to sit where we liked - on the way back same half empty but crew were charging GBP30 for window seats - they told us it was an upgrade.', 'Seat appalling - tiny falling apart TV screen a joke. Food - do not ask.', 'Very hard and uncomfortable seats on a long haul flight recline was poor no head rest sides to fold in to prevent your head from slipping. Very poor tv grainy and small and trying to remove the remote from the armrest with someone sat next to you is not the easiest. Trying to move in and out of the seat also proved a challenge. Have been in more comfort with budget airlines.', 'Upper deck standard economy seat. Seat in front is about 10\" from your face when reclined. Way back paid Ã‚Â£120 for pair of exit seats. No legroom worries or chair in the face worries but narrow (as tables take up space between). I had to get physically out of my seat to get at any of the controls. Ridiculous and incredibly uncomfortable.', 'Flew Virgin from Johannesburg to Heathrow sitting in Row 80 on the upper deck. I used to fly Virgin very regularly between London and the US but have not flown with them in the last 4 years and I have definitely noticed that the quality of the seating has deteroriated over that time. It almost feels like you are flying with a budget airline with the way Virgin have tried to cram every spare inch with a seat. I would be interested to know if they have changed the dimensions of the seats and the lefroom in the previous 4 years. The other minus point was the quality of the service The flight attendents could not have been more uninterested if they tried - it was very obvious that all they wanted to do was to feed the passengers and get to the back to chat with the other attendents. I would not fly Virgin again and based on this trip would not recommend them to anyone either.', 'Seats are very hard and uncomfortable you will need the pillow to sit on or put behind your back for more comfort.', 'Seats 20H/K Sydney-Hong Kong. Footrest on seat in front not good. Fare only good for extra 5 inches of seat pitch - not when front and rear passengers recline their seats. Could not exit our seats. Would prefer to pay for old style business class seats giving good access for both or shell seats where centre will not encroach into others space.', 'Manchester to Orlando with wife and 2 kids. (7 & 2) The seat was not as bad as expected and legroom was OK. Sitting in the seat with and without recline was OK but trying to sleep was difficult. The screen was OK but the one I had was not as clear as others. The armrest went up as far as the sitting position but was annoying when the seat was reclined.', 'Seat was terrible for comfort and armrest did not go all the way up it digs into your back. An experience I want to forget.', 'Armrests between chairs do not go all the way up seat was terribly uncomfortable no way is this a 31\" pitch as much as I hate BA their seats are way better.', 'Seat 61 D. Very very narrow (even for a small person like me!) extremely uncomfortable with no lower back support and a design that pitches your head and neck forward. Fold out table too small for food tray. Tables for the passengers in the seats to my right tipped forward! I will not choose Virgin Atlantic again for long-haul flights.', 'First and last flight with Virgin! Horribly uncomfortable seat dreadful viewing of the IFE screen poor service and poor food just made it even worse.', 'First and last flight with Virgin! Horribly uncomfortable seat dreadful viewing of the IFE screen poor service and poor food just made it even worse.', 'We were seated in 55H/K. Pitch and width both OK. Base of seat was hugely uncomfortable after a few hours - seemed to have very little padding. TV screen becomes all but useless if the person in front of you reclines even if you also then recline. On the return leg (LHR to SYD) we were on an older A340 which had the docking position for the entertainment controls on the inside of the armrest making it very hard to remove / replace while sitting down. The aircraft on the flight over had this under the screen which was far more sensible. My reading light seemed to be aimed right in between the seats and could not be adjusted.', 'I will never willingly travel Virgin Economy again after an excruciating 12 hours flight from London to Shanghai. I checked out the Premium Economy on my way out of the plane and have upgraded for my return flight because could not stand another 12-hour flight in those uncomfortable seats. I think they were the hardest I have ever sat on. Felt similar to flying Easy Jet but those are normally a 2 hours flight so your bottom does not go numb! I resorted to using my inflatable neck cushion to sit on. The other problem was the lack of a foot rest. Having recently suffered DVT it was important not to have my legs hanging down for 12 hrs (even though I wear stockings and walk around every few hours); Virgin had told me incorrectly that there would be one. I think it is irresponsible to have seats with no foot rests on long haul flights given the incidence of dvts occurring after these flights; raising your legs helps the venous return. All in all a terrible experience.', 'Seat pitch on this newish A340 was nowhere near the advertised 32 inches. It could not have been more than 30 inches. Remote for the video froze up two-thirds through the flight - could not even turn my reading lamp on. No pre-dinner drinks no offers of drink refills during dinner. Asked for a napkin with breakfast muffin and f/a told me \"we do not have any in this aisle although they do in the other aisle\" and left it at that. My first experience with VS and not a positive one.']\n"

both sides There is also a support strut directly in front of you so your feet are in a shared space This is a big step backward for Air Canada on a longhaul flight and I will take every possible precaution to avoid this configuration in future travel', 'For an 8 hour flight to Paris from Montreal the seats were pretty good I also liked Air Canadas new 3 cabin interior on this flight The seat recline was pretty good and I was able to sleep for awhile enRoute systems were amazing much better than the older system', 'Air Canada have gone with a very poor seat design both from the perspective of comfort and functionality The width of the seats has been reduced and there is no usable armrest space Plus in their wisdom controls for the PTV screen have been placed on top of the armrests so you are inadvertently putting the overhead light on calling the flight attendant or changing channel In addition the headphone jack for the PTV is next to the screen so the cabin staff are catching cables when serving trays in the limited space etc', 'The XM interior that Air Canada introduced a few years ago remains one of my favorite It provides everything you would expect out of a North American Economy class seat The pitch is beyond generous and I am able to easily stretch out and the width is acceptable The entertainment system is also excellent offering a wide variety of entertainment options Beyond ordinary economy class', 'Air Canada reconfigured some B777300 to squeeze more seats Economy class was changed from 3x3x3 configuration to 3x4x3 Seats shrank from 185 wide

pitiful on the recline only 3 inches and is pretty useless The seats on Rouge are called New Slimline Seats and they definitely are slimline especially on the cushion aspect as well as much narrower since they have jammed 3 seats across into the same space that used to have 2 across There is absolutely no lumbar support so lower backpain is the reward after a couple of hours 2 other aspects about the seats the actual length front to back of the seat is less than normal so no support for the upper thighs which can be problematic for some No inflight TV screen on the seatbacks just the foldaway

correct I really appreciated the service and I love the new brand image built on the French values the safety video is adorable I do recommend this airline for a longhaul flight', 'This was great I

airline This row is immediately behind the one behind a bulkhead ie behind the row often given to families  we were lucky to have a quiet family in front who slept as well as we did Passengers on those rows generally do not recline their seats so much due to the extra space in front of them consequently we in turn did not feel so trapped in our seats as passengers further back may have done

an outright disaster The seat area itself is way too short even for short people The seat hardly reclines at all The footrest leaves your feet in an awkward cramped position if you do not happen to be extremely short  shorter than 160 cm like me However not using the footrest will have your feet dangling in mid air There is a leg rest that you can swing out but since the seat is too short it will hardly support anything The seat is a disaster or an overnight long haul flight Air France should feel ashamed charging extra for these seats And it is not peanuts for us it was almost the double compared to Economy class fare', 'Decent legroom but very uncomfortable I had high hopes with it being my first flight on the A380 and it being a large modern aircraft The recline was almost nonexistent Also I really could not understand how the tv screen could be so badly designed I am an average height guy around 510 but could not see the screen properly when the seat in front was not reclined Anyone shorter would see nothing Who designed these things', 'This was unfortunately the most uncomfortable seat that I ever sat in on any long haul flight The seat looks very good on the

for a day flight where seating comfort does not matter much For an overnight long haul it is just a disaster', 'Seat number 30A the last row of this particular section meaning almost no recline or legroom A very old upholstery and more uncomfortable than other European carriers and Asian airlines I had booked another seat during booking', 'I flew in Premium Economy from LAX to CDG I agree that the recline on these seats is not great but the width of the seat and the fact that no one reclines their seat into your lap was worth the extra money I was able to sleep comfortably for the majority of the flight My husband is 510 and was able to stretch out and sleep comfortably in the seat The service was great Flight attendants were attentive but not bothersome We were on the upper deck which felt cozy with easy access to the snack bar and bathrooms Food and wine with dinner was good Breakfast was satisfactory also Also enjoyed not having to wake my spouse in order to get into the aisle

premium economy cabin was in very poor condition with obvious wear and tear that compromised some seat functions such as the leg rest The 8across seating meant the seats were very narrow  virtually the same width as the economy class cabin In addition on two separate longhaul flights one of the two toilets was not working', 'Not close to worth the added expense As noted in other posts the seats are rockhard and the recline feature is either not functioning or awkward and uncomfortable On both A380 and 777 they looked good from a distance but showed incredible wear and inattention to maintenance In a word shabby Customer service was nonexistent as to seat selection and my wife and I were arbitrarily separated on both LAXCDG and return No one could do anything about it despite requests weeks before the flights days before flights or at checkin The only real benefit was the priority boarding but I had rather save my money and upgrade to business This is no alternative', 'I flew with Air France from San Francisco to Paris The premium economy seat on this flight is the worst seat I have ever experienced No recline the seat just drops a few inches when you push the recline button Also the seat is hard as a rock it is more comfortable to sit on a parkbench To add insult to injury the entertainmentscreen did not work', 'The seat did not actually recline it sort of slid down and the front edge of the bottom seat cushion moved forward However it did not reach a position which was comfortable The footrest was terrible it was really a legrest that only extended about 23 the way from my knees to my ankles but all it did was press against my calves and cut off the circulation It was also difficult to put back had to press hard against it with my legs while pushing a button on the inside arm of the seat The table which was stored in the seat arm did not slide forward enough to provide room between it and my stomach  I am not particularly large so I do not know how someone who is heavier would even manage to use the table I had to have the seat completely in the upright position to be able to use the table at all and it was rather awkward trying to eat with it that close Also the seat adjustment buttons are right under where the table hinges so it is essentially impossible to adjust the seat when the table is out We were sitting in the first row on the right side of the plane so had lots of legroom I give the normal seats 4 of 5 based on my observation but I am not very tall so do not need a lot of legroom The video screen was in the other arm of the seat position when out was OK but not great a little low and of course off center', 'Adequate width Hardly any recline Seat bsase moves forward slightly and back rest moves with it to provide a minimum but not a comfortable amount Lower part of seat doubles as a rest for upper legs activated by button on seat Base of seat in front has foot rest However the seats are so close together than when the seat is in the reclined position and the leg rest raised it is impossible even to rest feet on for rest as it is too close I am of short stature and I was unable to sit comfortably for this reason I found it necessary either to have my feet supported which led to fatigue in the upper legs or to have my upper legs supported meaning that my feet were dangling Sleep was possible but only just Lights from other passengerÃ‚Â´ seats and screens is very intrusive and impedes sleep Everything is very close together giving no sense of privacy The seat rows are so close that anyone sitting away from the aisle can only exit if the passenger on the aisle seat moves which is inconvenient for all Unlike other reviewers I did not suffer any back pain or other serious discomfort but did not feel rested The seat I had originally been assigned to was broken the lower left rest disengaged and rose immediately I sat down  the latching mechanism was defective This problem could not be sorted out before departure However I was able to move to the next seat in the row If this had not been the case then I suspect I would not have been allowed to use the seat during take off and landing since I could not sit in the upright position Also the raised footrest would have impeded exit of the passenger sitting in the middle seat posing a safety hazard The seats appeared to be superior to the economy seats as far as the width was concerned However I do not consider the extra cost to be justified The price differential compared to what is on offer is far higher than eg from economy to business', 'After 40 years of intensive international travel I can safely say that these are the worst seats I have ever had the misfortune to occupy In addition to which the service was almost nonexistent and definitely not worth the premium price over a regular Y Class seat', 'Seat 91k is a seat plus beside the more available legroom i do not know what the plus stands for Seats is hard to

'It was a bulkhead seat 17H on 777300ER right behind the business class cabin Seat recline is ok and legroom is good The seat width however was horrible First reduced due to the tray table in armrest on top of that the remote for entertainment console is also placed in armrest and the holder pokes about an inch into the seat Uncomfortable to get in or out of the seat and nearly impossible to reposition yourself without getting out if you are slightly on the heavier side Better for people who feel comfortable in 16 inch seat width The entertainment screen is folded on a swiveling arm which folds behind your feet It was quite hard to move it into position joints were hard and amazingly the joint which is supposed to holed the screen upright was super smooth At initial deployment of the screen I had just started watching something with my legs crossed over each other and the screen fell swiveled on a horizontal axis at the bottom side of the screen and hit my shin quite hard For the rest of the flight I was rubbing my shin and keeping the blanket folded many times on my leg to prevent any further injury due to the screen I forgot to mention that the controls in the remote which was poking my thigh did not function Not just on my seat at least 6 more seats around me had the same issue Thankfully the touchscreen menu on the personal screen was working which enabled me to watch a movie not much more as the system response was very sluggish and music browse menu quite user unfriendly to use satisfactorily', 'One of the middle seats disgraceful for a flag carrier Almost as bad as Emirates 777  the only difference is the footrest on AF Never again', 'The Premier Voyageur cabin is intimate in size but spacious While the seats in this class are far superior to those in coach class there are drawbacks The fixed seat shell is marvelous as passengers do not encroach into other passengers space but the recline mechanism could be improved to provide greater comfort I fly the LAXCDG route annually and it is annoying that on every trip the passenger sitting behind me kept their window shades open or kept their reading light on throughout the flight There should be a period during the flight when passengers should be able to sleep The service as always at least in my experience flying AF is superior The food can be questionable but I will likely order the special meals for my next trip which appear to be superior to the standard meals offered', 'Flight from Paris to Hong Kong The seats were hard narrow and most uncomfortable even for a short flight 12 hours was torture', 'The personal monitors were out of service on both my wifes and mine on the way out On the way back the monitors front screen was cracked and mine was not working We were seated on the exit row and could not see the front main screen as it very fuzzy and working intermittently', 'Relatively new 777200LR The seats were comfortable for most of the flight but towards the end of the 15 hour flight they got a little stiff The recline was ok Another 12 inches of recline would have been great I am 62 tall and found the legroom to be adequate Not great but adequate The aisle seat would be the best bet for tall people The middle and window seats had some footspace taken away because there was a box mounted beneath the seat in front of the passenger', 'CDGMEX seat 53K Its in the narrower part of the aircraft at the rear so there are only 2 seats instead of 3 on the windows side IFE box was under the seat in front of me but to I was not too bothered by it The seat is away from the

person behind you Getting things in and out of it means removing anything sitting on top The IFE was okay selection of programs was fair However to select anything on the screen you had to press hard

French passport Never again', 'I literally thought it was a joke  that is how uncomfortable this seat and hence the entire trip was I am not exactly skinny but neither am I obese yet this seat was so narrow it cut off circulation to my thighs To make matters worse my shoulders and upper arms kept bumping up against the passenger to my right I was in an aisle seat to the point where I finally had to get up and pace around the plane to relieve the discomfort Throughout the entire trip from Miami to Paris I was lucky if I was able to sleep for 20 minutes I arrived at my destination in the Middle East feeling like I had been run over by a truck', 'In their Premium Voyageur cabin Air France has achieved the remarkable feat of making providing a seat which is uncomfortable for both my wife 56 and of medium build and myself 64 and of heavier build They are hard The recline is very limited when it works and the fixed head rest is too low to support the head of anyone with any height These problems were compounded by the failure to carry extension belts which fit the short seatbelts fitted on the second and third of the three rows I was able to use the belt on the A319 on the connecting flight without difficulty I therefore had to be transferred to the front row This has a bulkhead which diminishes the value of the extra legroom when the seat is upright when I tried to use the limited recline an extension came out which pinned my feet to the bulkhead In short this cabin is overpriced offering less than the preferred seats in the Air Canada Economy cabin', 'AF seats narrow and hard and it was very difficult to get comfortable Also I have short legs and the absence of a footrest is a real problem  I had to place cushions on the floor  place my feet on them to ensure adequate circulation in my legs My impression from 6 SINCDG legs is that the planes need a cabin refit with more comfortable seats On the other hand I would rate AF ahead of Qantass mediocre international economy offerings', 'I flew in the A380 going from CDG to IAD and then came back in the A330 ORD to CDG The 380 seat was spacious with a large screen while the A330 was cramped and had the tiniest of screens I gave such a poor rating for the recline due to when the person reclines completely in front you cannot eat easily get out of your seat see the TV screen very well or feel like you can breathe I did not feel comfortable putting my seat all way back in consideration of the person behind The seats also lead to people behind pulling on your seat when they try and get up and down from these cramped positions I will try and avoid this aircraft in the future on AF', '11hr flight from Paris Orly to La Reunion By far the narrowest seat I have ever sat in I think it was even narrower than the seats on Ryanair which is a budget airline Legs were pressed right into back of the seat in front and when they reclined it was game over Never again It is strange as I use Air France on European flights as well and the seats on the smaller aircraft are wider and with more legroom', 'I was seated 24K 3 seats jammed in behind a row of 2 seats 24J had minimum leg room and the

other economy seats to incorporate the tray table in the armrest Also the hardest seat I ever experienced How an airline can expect anyone to sit on this hard seat for twelve hours is beyond me Given cramped seating and the harness of the seat I will never choose Air France for intercontinental travel again', 'CDG to HKG with B777300 and HKG to CDG with B777200 Economy class on the day to HKG from CDG was full Very cramped cabin with 3x4x3 configuration The seat on the aircraft was like wooden bench I felt that the seat on B777200 on the way back to CDG was a bit better Has AF improved the seat Either way their economy seat is far from satisfactory Also on the way back to CDG they ran out of food available between first and second meal If you take a long haul flight with AF make sure that you take some food with you just like the time you take a budget airline', 'CDGLIS on A320 Very little legroom for a 62 ft tall One of the worst experiences compared to most European airlines', 'I was stunned to find the seats so miserably uncomfortable for an intercontinental flight The seats were extremely narrow short and very hard with very little leg room It became impossible for me to get

convenient Overall I would certainly choose this seat again I had a day flight both ways so did not try to sleep Seat was comfortable for the duration and I did not find it too hard As I was working most of the flight I did not use the recline much but it seemed OK The laptop power is standard 240V and either a standard French type or US plug will fit It is limited in power and my laptop which is fairly low power would only work if the battery was taken out That said the supply never faltered Video was good with a reasonable large screen although nobody could describe it as pin sharp and a good choice of current films and TV shows The earphones are OK but I used my own which plugged into a single 35mm socket so there was no need for an adapter Service was OK not bad but not exceptional and the food was standard economy fare OK but nothing to get excited about Overall a very pleasant flight and I do not think that I would have had much of a better flight in business class but I was not trying to sleep Overall plenty of room good comfort and easy boarding disembarking Highly recommended', 'Flew the new AF Premium economy product Pros hard shell seat gives feeling of extra space and good AV with noise reducing headphones and slot for own phones Socket for laptop also handy tho not used by me Seat reclines actually it declines in its shell enough to aid sleep Ticket class enables you to access AF lounge at CDG for a fee The seat is very thin and very uncomfortable over a long flight I bought a cushion in SCL for the return route but still had numb bum This detracts heavily from an otherwise good product Please AF put some more padding in the seat cushion', 'Extremely disappointing for 12hr flight Marginally better on return but could be due to pain killers I took', 'Entertainment is excellent But the seat configuration on B777300 at 3x4x3 makes it hard to survive after a 11 hours flight AF should definitely think about passenger confort I will never board those 777 again and I will prefer to choose another airline than AF on my next long haul flights to HKG and ICN', '12 hours from Hong Kong to Paris was awful  my seat would not recline very far as I was in front of the toilet  the seat width was the worst ever as was the pitch especially when reclining 3x4x3 is not the normal seating configuration on a 777 which explains why it was so cramped even for someone as short as I am', 'This BOSCDG flight was the worst transatlantic flight I have ever taken Very cramped seats I am small 52 not obese and could barely fit into it When person next to me pressed on arm rest it pinced my thigh enough to make me jump once or twice Seat so cramped that I could hardly move around to relieve pressure on legs Will never take this particular flight again', 'I was quite surprised at just how bad the seating was aboard our Air France 747 I consider myself to be of average build and height and fairly fit yet squeezing into the seat was incredibly difficult There was approximately one inch of space between my knees and the seat in front far less than the majority of shorthaul flights I make Extricating myself from the seat to get to the bathroom involved disturbing the two people sat next to me who were forced to get out of their seat and pile into the galley area because I wanted to leave After the problems I faced when I first attempt to get out of my seat I gave in and remained stationary for the remainder of the flight I dread to think how unpleasant the flight would have been if I was over 6 feet or weighed more than average I have since recommended that all of my friends and colleagues avoid Air France at all costs', 'CDGTokyo It was the worst flight in my life The seat was hard enough to feel like sitting on a plastic chair My back was very painful after a 12hr flight I chose the flight because it was the first time to fly with them and was the only flight departing Tokyo in late evening I never fly their B777300ER 3x4x3 layout aircraft again', 'Perfect flight but way too narrow seating in ecotempo No chance to get a sleep under these conditions Not recommended', 'CDGJFK Much better seating compared to Air France 777 models I recommend choosing the 330 if possible', 'CDG to Tokyo  the narrowest Y seat I ever experienced Took the flight because it was cheap turned out to be a mistake Never ever want to fly on such a cramped plane again horrible', 'Very tight seat pitch for long haul travel and not recommended at all If in economy try to obtain an exit row seat or seat 31K', 'Seats felt very cramped  worst I have ever experienced Who is the genius that decided to put in new thickly padded and sculpted seats which push you closer to the seat in front with the most recline I have ever seen in Economy but kept the seat pitch at 3132 When the seat in front reclined the video screen was 8 in front of my face and it is impossible to reach the floor or stand up for that matter It is ridiculously tight unless you are under 56', 'Not only would I not recommend these seats I will never fly on Air France again I have never seen seats so close together There was no leg room and I am not a large person As for the recline  the head of the passenger in front of me was practically in my lap', 'I had an aisle seat The seat itself was comfortable even for me at 2 meters tall and there was just sufficient legroom The problem was being an aisle seat people kept bumping into me all night long Not just passengers but the crew as well The aisle is only sixteen inches wide The passengers shoulders protrude beyond the back of the seat I complained to the crew and they said it was not their fault They said it was a huge problem for them and the airline just would not listen I resent being bumped into like this Normally an airline crew would apologise but I guess if you are bumping into people all the time you would never get any work done apologising all night Very disappointing when other aspects of the flight were excellent I checked the ATR aisle width and it is 19 inches A lot less people and a lot less movement of people about the cabin', 'I review this seat before I have even travelled in it Booked a spacesaver seat on 777300 on Friday paid my money Further to negative comments on this site about Air New Zealand changing aircraft type decided to check out this before travel Sure enough they have changed to an old 777200 no space seat usual old seat Been ripped off before I even fly', 'We purchased Brisbane to LAX return via Auckland Our premium economy booking specifically stated SpaceSeat and the space seat was the entire reason for our booking After boarding realised that we were on a777200 so no space seats Instead a very poor premium economy seat Another passenger asked about the 300 In a rehearsed reply the attendant said oh that is on another route this aircraft is new Never again', 'I am not a tall person at 54 and have a slim build but I found the seats in economy were small too close to the seats in front and had no footrest There was not even enough room to place my small cabin bag under the seat in front so I could elevate my feet The pocket in front of my seat was so small you could hardly put anything in it and if you did you had to take it out to get up from your seat I was unfolding my tray on this flight just as the person in front was reclining with the result of a good whack on my knees I have never experience this before I was extremely disappointed with the layout of this smart plane There appears to be too much room in Premium Economy and far too little in Economy There were only two toilets servicing our area of the plane', 'My wife and I have flown with Air New Zealand from Canada to Queenstown using premium economy since 2006 While the Premium Economy price is considerably more than the economy we have willingly paid the difference for the comfort experienced on the long haul Over the years we have experienced a variety of seating arrangements from the noticeable wider seats with more leg room to the moon seats which proved extremely uncomfortable and ultimately to the 777200 flight which offered us the worst imaginable flight experience The seats on our last trip to Queenstown and return were much narrower We questioned our memory of past flights and finally checked the economy seats Unfortunately economy seats did not look smaller than the premium economy Our trip on January 4th this year to Queenstown found us on the long haul flight bumping elbows as we sat There was no extra room to turn to choose a comfortable spot for sleeping To use the phrase disappointing with reference to our latest trip and my own flight to Queenstown last May of 2014 is an understatement The cost of our travel from Toronto to Queenstown was very close to 10000 for two adults When advised by two friends who also traveled to Queenstown one week after us that their individual economy fares were in the region of 2500 each I am left wondering why so much was paid for so little The premium economy accommodation would seem to be excessive in light of the meagre room afforded to your patrons of this class I would be interested to know why customer care has been cut back and to what end The crew are wonderful and every attempt is made within the cabin to accommodate travellers Too bad that travel space is now cramped for premium economy patrons', 'NZ2 AKLLAX Seat 46D One of the most uncomfortable long flights of my life The seats are extremely uncomfortable with poor cushioning Couldnt get comfortable at all Front pouch space is a joke Cant put anything there Had to put my cellphone on the floor I drink water quite a bit on long flights and there was no cup holder like on other planes usually on under side of tray Had to bring down the tray to put my water cup Unhappy with AirNZ cabin layout', 'We flew Brisbane to Auckland and then on to San Francisco I wish they flew direct from AU to the USA rather than transiting through NZ though I am 186cm tall and fairly solidly built but found these Spaceseats very comfortable Their 777300 planes are beautifully presented and the crew are always so friendly and helpful I hate flying long haul as I find the seats so uncomfortable on other airlines We flew Qantas PE to LA last year via Sydney on their A380 and found the whole experience very average What I love about the Spaceseat is that you do not have some clown reclining into your personal space forcing your food into your face or spilling your drink The TV screen is fine just move it to a better position There is plenty of room even for larger folk Its so comfortable and the cabin is nice and private The purple beanbagfootrest is very welcome Flip your shoes off and settle in The only thing that could be improved is the recline seating should be electronic buttons rather than manual Ignore the negative reviews you will love this seat Add to that the exceptional Air NZ service and you cannot go wrong I look forward to trying the PE in their new 787 planes but somehow feel that it will be a step backwards', 'If you are considering the Air New Zealand premium economy option do not waste your money I have flown this class with other providers without concern but the spaceseat is the most uncomfortable and worst ergonomic design My wife and I have ever experienced There is no foot rest very poor reclining and tilt options and poor head rest design The spaceseat provides NO place to put things except my glasses case any drink bottle book etc had to go on the floor or in the overhead locker The diagonal configuration creates a number of problems you need to twist at an odd angle to watch your video screen or if you extend it out on the arm it ends up very close to your face and prevents you leaving the seat without disturbing the person next to you The video remote is located in the seat by your elbow as a result is very easy to activate the functions when attempting to sleep no chance too uncomfortable I managed to turn on my screen and overhead lights and call the flight attendant all when trying to sleep If you own a motor bike and lock it up with a huge chain you will appreciate the seat belt design  Air NZ staff were very good as was the food and wine But the seats I felt I had spend 12 hours on the rack in some castle dungeon You have been warned go economy and buy 3 seats between two', 'We had a sky couch and as I am 6 foot 4 inches this was really a waste of time other than having an extra seat between the two of us We just could not get comfortable on the flight to get in a sleeping position The sky couch is rendered virtually useless when the seats in front fully recline and reduce the seating space dramatically There were two sets of people on our side of the plane with sky couch but neither used it I made the mistake of booking a sky couch rather than an exit row that would have been a better and cheaper option for us Air New Zealand pack an extra seat in economy and this reduces the width of seat and that may make an uncomfortable journey for wide people', 'Close to toilets means disturbance when trying to sleep Queuing random bumping from crew and other passengers and light from the toilet door all contribute Slightly less recline due to partition wall behind', 'These new refit by Air NZ are a horrific experience on a long haul The narrowest seats with the least legroom I have measured Less room and smaller than Air Asia seats When reclined cannot see the PTV screen as the angle is wrong Guy next to me was half on top of me I was in the isle seat and was kept awake the entire trip by people bumping into me People behind me were banging into the back rest and its impossible to recline because then you are right on top of the person behind It was a nightmare trip and I had jet lag for days after My advice is to not travel on this aircraft at all on long haul flight', 'I am a fairly frequent flyer on many different airlines This is the most uncomfortable flight I have ever experienced Very little seat width or leg room but worst of all the seat offers absolutely no lumberlower back support I chose to stand at the back of the plane for over 20 mins of the flight to give my self some relief from the discomfort', 'Premium Economy Auckland to LAX and one of the best long haul flights we have experienced We scored an upgrade paid to Business on the way back and although the ability to sleep on an actual bed on an overnight flight was a real plus we found there was a lot less personal space in Business compared to Premium Economy The downside was having to fly economyclass Auckland to Adelaide single class plane only I literally had to get out the seat 3 times during the 4 hour flight as my leg became so numb I was concerned any longer locked in that position would lead to serious health issues I was unable to point my foot upwards and had to sit locked in a splayed position whilst seated I cannot imagine how I would have coped with a 12 hour flight in that position', 'Trans Tasman economy class seating isvery tight I do not think I have every been in an aircraft with such small space Absolutely no leg room Im male 511 If the pax in front reclines during meal service you will be wearing it and video screen ends up 6 inches from your face', 'I fly often usually on Qantas where I am Gold or Virgin Australia This last trip 2 days ago I needed a fast direct flight so chose Air New Zealand I paid an extra 95 for an exit row air New Zealand are now an upscale budget airline with a cost for everything yet still charge Premium fare the seat although had plenty of leg room is very very narrow more so than I ever remembered in the past and more narrow than the other airlines I fly It was hard not to come into contact with the person beside me and we are both not big people The recline is almost non existent and both seat pouches are beside the window making it hard for the person in the aisle All in all I was very disappointed in what I thought were an above average airline', 'This is specific to the Air New Zealand SkyCouch Do Not believe the sales job on their website The notion of paying premium price for two adults in three seats to be able to lay down is a joke This would accommodate one adult at the most This is being marketed for adults and families to lay down on longhaul flights It is frustratingly cramped and the expectation set by the marketing makes it worse The flight attendants have obviously dealt with this before as they started apologizing before we took off from LHR to LAX We should have known something was wrong as the LHR ground staff would not look us in the eye when we asked about the SkyCouch seating Shame on Air New Zealand', 'The flight between the Cook Islands and Auckland had the most uncomfortable seats I have ever traveled in Armrests do not incline for added comfort if seat is empty next to you Inclination is practically nil and trying to grab a wink is impossible due to this as you pitch forward when nodding off', 'I was put in row 52 When seat in front reclined effective space disappeared Intolerable Had to ask them to straighten seat or risk an incident Temperature in this part of the plane was too hot At back of plane it was freezing No air control to regulate personal comfort I am only 162 m yet I found these seats claustrophobic and restricting to a degree worse than older plane layouts A six foot passenger next to me had to sit with knees splayed further restricting my available space', 'Worst flight ever 95 hours of being cramped and uncomfortable Paid 300 per person to have guaranteed empty seat next to us which cabin staff ignored woke up to find someone sitting in the empty seat Once this was pointed out to staff they did move her Guy in front of me was fidgeting and moving up and down tv was about 5cm in front of my face during dinner not so much cattle class as sardine class', 'We flew to LA from London initially outbound in economy While the seats themselves were nice and comfy the one downside is that if you have your seat up and the person in front reclines you have a TV screen inches from your face which made for a incredibly uncomfortable journey On the return trip we tried the skycouch 2 adults travelling and there is much improvement depending on what you want to use it for We reclined the seats back and put it into bed mode For us this was fine as my girlfriend was happy to sit upright in the isle seat which allowed me to lay across the 3 seats The extra width was lovely and made for a far more comfortable journey even for my girlfriend who was now able to put her feet up also The people in front did not recline giving us more space but the problem would still exist with the screen being close if they had and because of this I think if 2 people were to lay side by side with the seat in front reclined it would make it more like a coffin for one person Saying that if you want to take turns with laying out then I would highly recommend paying the bit extra for have more sittinglaying options and generally more comfort We are flying again with ANZ on the same journey and have booked the hard shell space seat to see if this improves the journey I could not find a fault with the rest of the airline staff entertainment and food were all first class hence why we are flying again', 'I did a lot of research before I booked theAir New Zealand space seat to LA and back  on the way out we sat in the middle section seats that sort of curved slightly  the seats were amazing the recline is more of a slide and the controls are a bit stiff but when you get the hang of it they are fine the table and TV all moved about as did the arm rests the big middle armrest between the seats is great too  the seatbelts have an airbag so they are a bit bulky at one end  the bean bag for your feet was a bit flat and small  but on the return journey I had a much bigger bean bag Leg room was fantastic but you do sort of angle a bit so it feels a bit odd twisting one way with your tv etc angled at the other but you get used to it  on the way back we were sat in the window seats and they are not like the middle ones they are off set from each other so there is more privacy I did find these ones had a little less room for your armelbow on the joining side but nothing major  there was also plenty of room to get in and out of your seat and it felt very spacious I was really impressed with the whole experience on this flight the seats the services everything was special and I highly recommend it', 'We had to ask for assistance from cabin staff every time to try to get recliner seat activated  they did apologise and said there has been problems with this  but it is not fixed On the first flight over to USA the cabin was not at full capacity and I tried other seating on other rows and experienced the same discomfort Having been on both the inside and middle seating  there is no difference in comfort and I defy anyone to be seated in the middle seats as shown in the brochure in the seat pocket  I did try and it is impossible Sleeping was almost non existent due to the headrest being too rigid', 'Took a flight from AKLHKG Was seated in 44A and 44B Economy Class The seat

upright position so everyone could eat propoly Overall good seats', 'Premium Economy Row 24 middle 2 seats Heathrow to Auckland via LAX in October Excellent seats I was pretty concerned as when they were launched they received a lot of negative press as the legroom was alleged to be awful Air New Zealand removed a row of seats in August to remedy this It worked  I am 65 and with legs fully stretched could just about touch the back of the footwell  so loads of legroom The recline could be a tad better but did not prevent me sleeping The hard shell means your space is not intruded by the seat in front', 'Had to be the worst seats I have been in If the person in front of you reclines they are just inches from your face Plus people who seem to feel the need to constantly push back in their seat makes your table shake making for an unpleasant dining experience It was very difficult to get in and out of the seat and I was in an aisle seat I have bruises on my legs and my right knee bruised from knee being up against the seat in front of me The armrests do not go completely up so I can see the other passengers being bruises from banging against them every time they try to get in and out of their seats Worst seating I got off my flight bruised and with a very sore and stiff neck', 'The new space seat  pros and cons I have travelled in both an inside and outside seat on the right and left of the two aisles and not the oddlooking awayfacing pairs in the centre so my comments apply to the former You sit at an angle of about 20 degrees to the aisle with the backs of the seat shells in front of you at the normal right angle to the aisle This means that your TV which can just about compensate for the offcentreness and your tray table which cant are at a weird angle The window seats have better leg room than the aisle ones but the down side is that getting out  particularly if the aisle person has the TV out on its angled stilts and the tray table open no rim glassholder or recess beware is a mountaineering job  but at least using the shell in front as a lever will not disturb the occupants Air New zealand are obviously sensitive about it as on both flights the concierge were on the defensive unsolicited on my last flight  Weve taken one row of seats out Heaven knows what it was like before But despite them being a bit hard one can get quite

armrests but most had minimal retraction  row 46 none Passengers should be advised on seat maps  we booked months in advance and had the worst seats on the flight thanks to a check in clerk who moved us to supposedly better seats We travel this route regularly and will try to avoid Air New Zealand if they do not wake up and do better in future', 'This was on the brand new B777300 only the 5th

that did not quite line up and these seats are also quite narrow Incidentally seating is unreserved on these flights Cabin bag limit is very small on this aircraft but you can ask the FA to stow your bag in the rear  you will need all the space under your seat and there is not much room in the open rack above', 'The worst seat I have ever had on a trans Tasman flight Arm rests do not fully retract up making it very hard to get in and out of your seat If the seat next to you is empty the fact that the armrest will not fully retract makes it impossible to use the extra space Seat was hard insufficient legroom seat to narrow', 'The benefit of these 747s is the 34 seat pitch 2 more than on the 777s Having sat in the seat for some 24 hours it was getting uncomfortable towards the end of the journey but at least you are invited to stretch your legs by walking around the cabin Seat recline is good and your leg space is not seriously compromised when the seat in front is reclined fully back Economy is never going to be really comfortable but the seat pitch offered by Air New Zealand goes a long way to making it more bearable', 'I had paid a fraction of the cost as part of an upgrade from London to Auckland The 777s as noted before suffer from having the same layout as economy but the seats are better The airline I gather is going to reconfigure these aircraft during 2009  not before time The service and food made for a very good flight and the seat was comfortable enough for the flight from Tokyo Those paying full rates for this service may feel it does not reach the required standards of seat comfort though', 'Worst long haul flight with Air New Zealand I have made Added to the awful seat pitch was the fact that the armrests which usually recede completely into the seat backs no longer do so So although the flight was only half full it was impossible to utilise the spare seats next to me On a 135 hours flight from SFO to AKL this becomes very important Food and service okay but if the seats are diabolical then everything else pales into insignificance', 'I have travelled Premium Economy previously on an Air new Zealand 747 The product on the 777 is far inferior and not worth the extra fare  the seat was cramped the same width as the economy seats whereas the 747 premium economy seats are somewhat wider Air New Zealand should have configured the 777 premium cabin as 232 or even 233 The 178 inch width of this premium economy seat is 07 inches narrower than Air Canadas standard economy seat on the same aircraft type', 'We have made several journeys in the upper cabin premium economy section Not being in the least interested in business class the premium economy is an excellent alternative However I do find the seat padding tends to set solid after about 8hours I now have an additional cushion that that has largely eliminated this problem Even double long haul legs ie LHR HKGAKL are good value and comfortable in these seats', 'We were in seats 22 A and B upper deck but were fortunate enough not to have a third passenger in seat C giving us more room to spread out although I believe we would have been comfortable even with a third person These seats are in the exit row so leg room is not an issue nor is the narrowness of the seats I have heard complaints about the temperature but that was not a problem with the blankets

The leg room is spacious leaving enough work space so that I can work on my lap top without disturbing the person next to me  coach seating has become so cramped on airlines that you tend to overlap each other Plus the blankets were comfortable and there were extra pillows for my flight  it was great Some over weight people may find the seat width a little small for premium economy Qantas Premium Economy seems a little larger but for a normal sized woman it is perfect', 'LAXPPT You do not have many airline options flying inout of Tahiti so Air Tahiti Nui is kind of the only way to go That being said I am not sure who designed the seats in Moana Economy Class but I have no idea what they were thinking with the headrest The seats are as expected in economy class  not much leg room narrow worn and used seats I am your average 55 female and felt the space was adequate enough although man spreaders definitely make the space more cramped My biggest gripe is the headrest which can move up or down but for the most part feels like someone is shoving your head forward into the most uncomfortable position in the world Theres just no way to get comfortable For an 8 hour flight from LAX it makes sleeping difficult even if the seat is all the way reclined The best you can do is sleep with your head tilted forward and arms crossed over your chest Most positive comment would be the IFE which had a number of on demand moviesshows which was easy to use Nice big crisp touch screen Food was not the greatest but they feed you twice on each leg of the trip FAs friendly enough French and English', 'The screen was very difficult to work and hard to view Food was quite good The one thing I really noticed was that they did not walk down offering water as frequently as travellers need The bathrooms were really small and I honestly wondered how heavy set people go into them', 'We have flown quite a few airlines over the last few years and Air Transat is not bad but its not good either Firstly the seats flying this airline you are going to get well acquainted with the person at the side of you Most airlines we have flown use a 2x4x2 configuration which is ok using a 3x3x3 means you are very cramped We flew a different airline earlier in the day with the 2x4x2 in the same body and it was much more comfortable I am 185 cm and I have broad shoulders and I was very uncomfortable for the transatlantic flight The width of the isle was so narrow that I was not possible to pull my hand luggage along the floor You will have to pay for a blanket and headphones on this airline The in flight entertainment system is ok full touch screen but a limited number of movies and shows The service was good but it was obvious that the flight attendant was not fluent in French when making her announcements which for a dual language airline is not what you would expect The attendants were friendly Food was ok but there was not enough Flying this airline again I will make sure that I eat plenty before the flight Overall I think it would be better to pay more for an airline with better service', 'Calgary to Gatwick 1st July 2015 Airbus A330 The only good point about this flight was the condition of the aircraft However the seats were hard slippery narrow and very uncomfortableThe cabin crew were rude and unhelpful not a a hint of please or thank you at any time The food was diabolical and very little of it eg a slice of Banana Bread for a snack breakfast The air travel side of our Canadian Holiday should have been one of the highlights instead it turned out to be the only regret', 'London to Calgary and back again Seats become very coccyx unfriendly after an hour or so Either the seat or I do not have enough padding Spent most of the flight wriggling around trying

was sat in 8C Being just over 2 metres tall there is barely a flight where the seat pitch is great enough in economy for me The pitch was just about bearable and I could put my right leg out a little

hours in that seat would have been too much to bear', 'At 6 foot tall I am not that big by western standards I expected some comfort but I could not find any My seat did not recline and I could not

for full flat position solution  make it a little less flat and it is much more comfy Service was excellent with the friendly crew showing a flair often absent these days Food is the same as available for economy A unique product for a LCC which I will be using again My ratings are in the context of an LCC', 'I paid extra for what Air Asia X calls a hot seat with more legroom directly behind the premium economy cabin The legroom was generous I am 194 cm and I could stretch out and the space in front of the seat also made access very easy However in a crowded plane the lack of shoulder room was very uncomfortable  this airline has nine seats across in its A330 cabin where most airlines have eight The sense of tightness was exacerbated by the armrests on my row of seats having to accommodate tray tables narrowing the available space further The seats themselves are leather clad and hard they also lack lower lumbar support They do have adjustable head rests  a great feature I have rated the seat overall as a 5 simply because I managed to sleep for about two hours of a seven hour plus sector I have rated the PTV screen as 1 in fact the onboard entertainment system comes in the form of portable units which can be rented  I did not try them however', 'My seat row 26 had very little to no recline whatsoever and it was not an emergency row From Honolulu to San Diego 55

flights The aircraft appeared old it did not have the Italian colours but the tail was blue with a design I did not recognize The seats were filthy stained and with the cover of the back coming unglued My tray at least was unsteady and it seemed on the verge of detaching from the supporting system The leg room was sufficient for my height and body type I am 58 and 170 lbs but for anyone taller or heavier it would be extremely uncomfortable The overhead monitor did not work and neither did the sound system The food its not worth the comment I think the president of this Airline should

the two class version had new seats with IFE Old very old seats with no cushion left in the cushioning and no inseat back IFE Rather we had a CRT every 10 rows and ours was broken This means that the Seat arms go up all the way and no boxes to block legroom The bad  well seat back IFE is essentially the standard now So I am of two minds The leg room and fully disappearing arm rests are good The old cushionless cushions very bad The lack of seat back IFE that is just unusual and very third world So if you are taking a night flight the plane is not full and you do not need to be entertained

over 2 hours To add insult to injury to the frequent flyer there are only 8 first class seats giving a ration of 1 to 14 of first to economy By comparison the outgoing MD80 had 16 first class seats

screens For starters there are three 10x12x4 metal boxes possibly to run the TVs attached to the pedestals They dramatically reduce the space for personal items and therefore increase the pressure on the precious overhead bins In a world where the power of a 1980s IBM 360 can practically be delivered in a smartphone it is inelegant at best and embarrassing at worst that these huge clunky boxes are the solution for the new seats Also the back pocket is now just 1 a hard plastic sleeve filled with AA magazines and 2 a net pocket below that is so small and pulls out notatall leaving room for a couple of business cards', 'Worse than how thin the cushions are the shape of the seat is exactly opposite of what it should be for good back posture There needs to be lumbar support Instead this seat

I suggest if you are a pound over 150 you do not consider this plane especially if you are on it for a long ride Our trip was 65 hours I think the discomfort is on purpose because they will sell you an upgrade which gives you 46 more legroom than the regular seats have I had to upgrade because I became nearly claustrophobic thinking about having to climb back into that confined space And tho the legroom helped and the fact that I was on the aisle instead of in the middle the seats were so narrow that I came off the plane with a six inch bruise from the armrest It will be a long long time

So I checked on Sat 18th and Sunday 19th and on both occasions the only seats that were available were 22111 so 7 in total Therefore I felt that I could not wait until Tues 21st for online check in as I wanted to ensure that I sat next to my wife So with that in mind I prebooked 2 seats 15a and 15b to ensure that we sat together and the extra Ã‚Â£50 However when I checked the seat availability again on Mon 20th and Tues 21st I was shocked to see that there were plenty of seats available When I saw this I felt I had been forced and cheated by BA to pay an extra Ã‚Â£50 this left a bitter taste in my mouth and was angry with the way I had been treated by BA The flight was delayed for 1 hour 40mins without an explanation as to why Ok these things happen but an explanation as to why were were delayed would have been appreciated By the time the cabin crew came round with the supposed lunch it was close to 3pm and by the time the cabin crew reached us they could not offer us a choice of food and the only thing that was left was Fish Therefore we were left with 2 trays of front of us with a salad bowl a bread roll an empty cup and an empty glass and a napkin with various cutlery totally useless if you have no food to eat Eventually crew managed to find a Chicken dish that we could eat The Club Europe cabin was not sectioned off to the economy class passengers So these

flight Other people around me who were larger than me but not big people by any stretch of the imagination had to keep their arms folded for the whole flight in order to fit in the seat Lots of people

sticking out too far and there was insufficient room to get my leg under the seat On the return my seat offered better leg room but despite many empty seats BA allocated two large men next to me I had to have my carry on case to keep my leg elevated which meant the two men were trapped in their seats BA did not ask to see my Drs letter to understand what I was going through The staff did their very best to avoid all eye contact with passengers presumably in case we asked for something My headset socket did not work but the staff just blamed the previous crew I could write about the state of the

with my knees pressing into the seat in front This became even more uncomfortable once the passenger in front reclined their seat I could not move my legs due the large entertainment system metal box

so these are not usually available to reserve until 24 hours before departure unless you are travelling with an infant The AB side of the aircraft are served first for everything so you have a better chance of getting the meal of your choice on that side of the aircraft rather than the JK side All seats are much much better than normal economy and definitely worth paying the extra for the premium

World Traveler Plus seats The seats are a step up from the shabby WT seats on the 747400 we had on our outbound flight The seats were slimline with very little seat padding and poor lumbar support Probably the best feature of the new WT seat is the larger AVOD monitor built into the back of the seat in front The new AVOD system is far superior especially the moving map function There is a foot rest that drops down from the seat in front it is nice but does not add much to the experience Lavs just two of them one on each aisle are located just aft of the WT cabin and are shared with the main WT cabin otherwise you have to hike back to the very rear to make use of the lavs there Like other BA longhaul aircraft the 777300 does not have passenger air vents above the seats in WT or WT Because the cabin temperature is kept at nearsauna levels the lack of vents can make the trip very very uncomfortable Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is that legroom is restricted by two metal equipment boxes under the seats in front The boxes restricted the ability to stretch legs and effectively prevented storing any carryons under the seat in front While the new WT has its shortcomings it is still far superior to anything offered by US carriers as a premium economy product For us the positives were worth the cost belong regular WT and in any event the cost of WT was far less than what we would have paid for Club World', 'We flew SEALHR on an aging 747400 in World Traveler Plus seats 29 J and K near the 3R door BA boards WT dead last The seats were the old WT and showed their age in all respects worn dirty etc the AVOD monitor for seat 29J was so badly scratched and smeared that it was difficult to watch anything The cabin was unbearably warm be aware that BAs longhaul fleet evidently do not have seat air vents  so no way to keep cool Seat 29K has no seat in front of it which makes leg room excellent and also allows for easy access to and from the seat to the aisle and area around the exit door Seat width is poor and the seat has function buttons and AVOD controls on the inside of the arm rest making access and use very difficult While it is true that the cost of WT is far less than the cost of Club World there is a big difference in seat comfort and the ability to get any real restsleep On the other hand WT is far superior to what US airlines offer as their premium economy product eg Delta economy comfort on its 767300 on the same SEA to LHR route', 'This had to be the most uncomfortable flight in the world we flew American airlines LHRMIA 777300er and the seats were comfy and the flight entertainment worked On the way back we flew BA from MIALHR and it was really bad I do not recommend sitting in row 3336 as the leg room is reduced and the seats are uncomfortable I had a headphone set that did not work and a box under the seat in front of me so I did not have any leg room for my left foot now me being 6ft something and as a 15 year old teenager who likes a bit of leg room found it difficult to find some I had flown from PLSMIA before that flight to LHR but could not get any sleep because of the most uncomfortable chairs I am willing to give BA another go

available Usually the extra cost is about Ã‚Â£500 and I try to use points and money to further upgrade but that is usually a lottery and not often successful I followed a similar procedure with a BA flight form LHR to JNB on an A380 and was in premium economy on the upper deck at the front bulkhead so leg room was not a problem but the seat itself was very disappointing compared to other BA flights I have been on in essence it was a an economy seat with more leg room and a worse than useless leg rest which did not come up far enough to support your legs comfortably In addition BA are missing a trick as these 7 bulkhead seats could have a small food rest attached to the bulkhead so you could stretch your legs out completely A further premium could be charged I am sure not dissimilar to the practise of many airlines In future on this route I will save my money and fly economy as I did not see a Ã‚Â£500 premium in the seat Ã‚Â£300 tops I have just had a look at the BA web site and the same return flights as mine for next week has an Ã‚Â£1800 premium utter madness', 'We had a miserable experience flying directly from Phoenix to Heathrow and back The seating was much

cabin service is more personal and although the food and drink is the same it is served with cloth serviettes and steel cutlery How do they get steel knives through security The main benefit though is that there were lots of empty seats while coach on this flight from CPT to LHR was full The biggest letdown is the tiny lowres TV screen One factor in favour of coach is that the handrests fold back

the aircraft narrows  meaning the configuration switches from 3x4x3 to 2x4x2 Much more legroom and plenty of storage space  plus decent accessibility Generally the seats on the BA 747s are reasonably comfortable and have a clever adjustable headrest which provides good neck support The seats are not the new slimline versions used by other carriers and so have decent padding Definitely adequate for a 7 hour flight  but am sure on long flights to HKG SIN SYD or NRT discomfort could become an issue Both B747s we traveled on must have been over 15 years old but in good shape  clean cabin and toilets etc No issues with food and service was good although an observation  BA do not tend to station cabin crew in the Economy cabin during boarding to assist passengers with luggage  finding seats

check in opening Best advice is to just complete online checkin early to ensure best seat selection', 'Clean aircraft friendly personal decent service It was way better than I first expected Of course

short haul 4 hour flight Although seats do not recline and the person at the front will not lean back and occupy your limited space hard shells are not comfortable when compared to other ordinary seats and I do not feel relaxed at all These seats should not appear on an aircraft of a 5star airline If Cathay wants seats that do not recline so much and occupy ones place at the back maybe they could choose ordinary seats that could recline but with a max angle fixed so as to reduce effects on the person at the back On the other hand seat legroom was just acceptable not satisfactory enough

airlines and no complaints about the A300 seat comfort access or configuration However the A340 shell seats are hard uncomfortable and the worst I have sat on The fact that the seat does not recline from your hips and merely slumps you downwards putting an immense amount of pressure on your lower back and bottom is terrible for getting any kind of sleep rest or even just general comfort I am average height and small build but I can only imagine with horror what this might feel like for taller or bigger built people When slumped in the seat there then appears a large gap between the paper thin seat padding and the headrest causing further spinal issues with no support for your head neck and shoulders As a final insult the seat belts have an airbag in them which makes one side of the belt extremely bulky quite weighty and cumbersome so that even just sitting upright never mind trying to sleep is uncomfortably restricted by this bulging leather strap Theres also limited leg room under the seat in front not sure why but it is probably the fault of the shell seat design being so low to the floor and there is also very limited space in the seat pocket annoying when you cannot fit much under the seat either The only saving grace this aircraft design has is the configuration I was travelling with just one other person and it was nice to just sit in a twosome without fear of the dreaded middle seat or clambering over a stranger while they sleep to go to the restroom', 'Flew Paris to Hong Kong in a shell seat that does not recline Impossible to sleep and my TV did not work

slouching whereby the bottom cushion that you sit on slides forward enforcing a type of involuntary slouch in the seat There is no back support and any flight time of longer than say two hours this is absolute torture Sleep is near impossible as in addition to this the seats are extremely hard', 'This is the new economy seat that have replaced the fixed back shell seats The seat has good pitch very good width and storage with the cubbin on the seatback plus three pouches below the literature pocket all very useful for a long flight The AVOD system is great but only needs more and better choices of programs and games Two major problems with these new seats  the base seat cushion becomes hard quickly and the recline intrudes greatly on personal space and privacy At two hours on a 15 hour flight the seat became noticeably uncomfortable My legs became numb from pinched circulation at about 3 hours The new 6 inches recline is nice when you are sitting in it but intrudes greatly into the space behind you The unpredictability of a 2 to 6 inch recline creates stress Your knees get banged laptop knocked off the tray table etc And your personal space and privacy is mostly in control of the whim of the passenger in front of you Also the thinner and lighter seat material makes for a smaller seat footprint which amplifies the loss of privacy when the person in front or to your side reclines When the adjacent seat reclines if you are to the right you get an almost full view of their TV screen That can be a distraction to you as their screen flashes when you want to read or sleep', 'I am a large man and it was agony flying from Los Angeles to Bangkok No power plug for the laptop Seat rows too close to use the laptop as the space was too small to unfold it Seats were fine

back does not incline but the seat pad slides forward instead without any support at the waist Back cushion is so thin that I felt laying on a piece of steel Head rest makes my neck painful Simply a nightmare and as such I will not take CX again', 'In the viewing position seating is comfortable as there is a natural recline and you get decent support Cushions seem standard You have good view of the screen with good inflight entertainment In the sleeping position however it is torture The back support could not be adjusted the bottom seat slides forwards a few inches instead There is not a great sleeping position You just get neck problems whilst sleeping and need to support your neck whist waking up For long haul flights and for sleep these are absolutely the worst seats', 'This was one of the older Boeing 747400s in the China Airlines Fleet so therefore there was a lack of entertainment in Economy Class only an inflight magazine was provided even on a long flight like ours which

recess under the IFE screen for storing phones cameras wallets glasses etc a nice touch Thumbs up to CX for carving slits into this recess so you can easily see if you have left any valuables as you deplane', 'The seats on both these flights from Perth to London were the most uncomfortable we have ever travelled in', 'On the upright position you get decent support even though the cushion is a bit thin and hard compared to standard airlines seats In the recline position however you get pretty much no back support as you end up sliding down below the head rest to get into any type of position conducive to sleep For flights under 5 hours I would choose these seats over standard reclining seats You have good view of the screen there is a power outlet and you can enjoy the inflight entertainment Where Cathay made the mistake is for long haul flights where people are inclined to sleep for some portion of the flight For sleep these are absolutely the worst seats I think they made a mistake in installing them on their transcontinental flights In an ironic note if you do not want to sleep on your flight these seats are the best If you want to sleep choose a different airline If you want to stay awake the whole time which for flights arriving at night in either direction helps with the jetlag I would choose Cathay', 'China Airlines A330 configuration means that in the front

however the seating within the shell slid to make believe you reclined After being loaded on the plane and being told that we had to wait for 10 mins for connecting passengers to join our flight after sitting for this period the seats then became extremely uncomfortable Butt and back padding is very slim and had to travel our whole return trip from Rome via Hong Kong to Sydney with the pillow and blanket at my lower back this made the seat just bearable however frequent moving and getting up standing for multiple periods of time made the trip just manageable The only benefit of this type of

had squeezed so many seats into the plane that there was no space even around the exit area  if there was an emergency it would be chaos The next problem was the fact that Cathay economy seats do not recline so I had the trip from hell being over 6 foot as my head kept falling forward despite a support pillow On this airline they think that by having the bottom of the seat slide forward you have comfort  wrong I had no sleep in 24 hours', 'There was no recline Seat pad moved forward slightly which brought my knees up against the seat in front Because of design of seat there was no head support and pillow supplied did not fill the gap between back of my head and seat The airbag attached to the seatbelt caused problems when the passenger in the adjoining seat moved they pushed down on

have already reviewed the new seats They are actually appalling  the worst I have ever experienced They do not recline and for myself and my husband that made sleep impossible Whenever we tried to fall asleep our heads would loll forward the breathing became restricted and we immediately woke up The slide forward motion of the horizontal seat only succeeded in creating a nonsupported gap behind

did not have any other alternative The seats confirmed my worst fears They are just awful I am 6ft 5 and if you choose your seat carefully on line before getting to the airport then you can at least get some legroom if you are lucky The real issue is comfort There simply is not any as the seat cusion is just too thin The recline or slide forward motion is awful as well I had a really sore lumbar on arriving back in London as you cannot get comfortable and sleep is nearly impossible in an upright position Warning Take a seat and neck cushion Its hard to believe that this refurbishment was I hope researched and tested prior to introduction If it had surely it would not have progressed', 'The shell seats offer a personal space in which nobody can intrude There is good lumbar support if you

from Vancouver to Delhi via Hong Kong in February Although there were two different aircraft involved each with a different seat configuration the seats were the same  the worst I have ever experienced Very little legroom but worst of all the seats did not recline All that could be done was to slide the seat bottom forward which only gave the illusion of leaning back a bit This put my back into a painful slumped position and because the seat back was still upright my head and neck were pushed forward Within half an hour I had excruciating back pain which I could not get rid of regardless of how I positioned myself On such a long flight as Vancouver  Hong Kong such seats seem absurd since it is pretty much impossible to sleep I was miserable the entire time and could only pray that the seats between Hong Kong and Delhi would be different They werent When the agonising trip was finally over and I was finally in India I kept having the awful realisation that I was going to have to sit in the same torturous seats all the way home again', 'I am on the tall side 6 2 and skinny and found the shell seats some of the worst airline seats I have ever sat in The issue is the way they recline since the seat slides forward the headrest never allows your heads center of gravity to get behind your solders This makes it very hard to sleep because your head keeps flopping forward The other issue with the recline on these seats is that the seat base slides forward making it very hard to extend your legs out under the seat infront of you The overall result is a truly uncomfortable slouch', 'We paid 100 extra for each flight to have Extended Legroom Seats Unfortunately this put us in Row 31 beside an exit door The cold and the noise from the door were both

Hong Kong This was our first experience of these seats and the torture they induce We each tried to cope with the unnatural shapes the seat contorts your body into by adopting different positions  enduring neck back andor tailbone pain as a result These seats are unquestionably the worst we have ever experienced I am just glad we left our 6 plus son behind We assumed this was an old planeold design having just visited the Cathay site I am shocked to learn they are being lauded particularly given all the negative reviews', 'For an economy seat leg room was good even with the seat recline

the seat sliding forward into a recline rather than by tipping the seat back into the lap of the guy behind This must lower passenger tension and airrage and is surely worth it I will no longer have to fight for an exit row or bulkhead seat again', 'Let me assure tall people who wrote in hypothesising that their height contributed to their discomfort on these sliding seats it had nothing to do with it I am 53 found Cathays seats to be poorly designed Short people have spines too and the lack of lumbar support affects these stubby structures in a similar way The only difference I noticed was that instead of having my knees pushed into my neck by sliding forward as taller folk experienced my head slid so far down the seat that the nifty head support gizmo spent most of the trip acting as a

seats do not recline at all but only slouch forward Unless you are 58 or shorter you should plan on spending the whole trip bolt upright because the slouch position bangs your knees into the seat in front of you and provides no back or neck support On one leg of the flight there were empty seats next to me but I could not use them to recline because the armrests only fold up partially One can

horribly cramped and unbearably uncomfortable flight The crew were not really interested in my problem Add to that a plane that needed cleaning properly really how did the cleaning staff miss a large

for take off the stewardess did not even notice the reclining seat They really do not check properly As far as I am concerned when the person in front of you fully reclines their seat they are

one hour by a duststorm that we understood had been raging for several days We boarded the B777 for DXBDAR on time only to sit on the stand for some two hours whilst other flights were given greater priority to take off in the limited visibility caused by the duststorm To be fair the flight and service on this leg was quite reasonable once airborne However we arrived at DAR so late that we had missed our onward flight to ZNZ and had to pay for a replacement and to add to the stress Emirates had opted to leave one of our bags either at LHR or DXB The return from DARDBX was good but the having boarded the A380 at DBX very efficiently the departure from the stand on the DXBLHR was delayed for an hour due to a medical emergency obviously not Emirates fault Once airborne it was again evident that the cabin crew simply cannot cope with the number of passengers a fully loaded A380 and once again service did not match expectations From past experience Emirates has always warranted its 4 star rating but standards have clearly slipped in recent time and that is no longer the case We will need to find an alternative airline for our next trip to DARZNZ', 'This was the most

Then why offer it Our row was not offered tea or coffee during the meal service Just prior to landing the female flight attendant decided to tidy her hair and apply makeup in the galley mirror which

you will read about the 2x4x2 section at the very rear of the aircraft are true 46K had more legroom space between the seat and the window and an overall feeling of a bit more privacy The cons to 46K are that the armrest between 46J and K is a permanent one that cannot be raised or lowered This might have eaten into the already slim seat width a bit but it did not bother me being 58 and average size Another con to being at the very back of the plane is that it takes a long time to deplane and they were out of the meal I wanted by the time they got to me 28A was just fine but only because there was no one in the middle seat next to me Originally there was and after the doors we closed the FA came and found him an aisle seat to move to Before he moved however I was already sore from leaning against the window just so our shoulders would not touch Had he stayed there the entire 135 hours flight that would have been terrible The 3x4x3 layout overall is a bad idea for passenger comfort Not only are the seats shoulder touchingly narrow but the other comments you have read about the aisle width are very true I had to sidestep down the aisles to try and avoid bumping other passengers And at mealdrink service time Forget it I did not have a problem with the lack of a footrest as some have commented Sure it would have been nice to have but my feet touched the floor just

for the comfort of its passengers I requested an aisle seat and even the trolleys could hardly manage to make it through the aisles Everyone had to walk sideways I was hit and jostled constantly by people coming through they could not help it I am 1m73 and felt the seat already on my knees When the person reclined it was even more uncomfortable I spent most of the flight standing up rather than sitting in that uncomfortable seat To make matters worse there was the video for the row in front of me on the floor where I should have been able to put my feet the row in front was the exit row so I

exit row as your tv screen and table are stored between the seats However fortunately you have legroom I cannot imagine having done a flight on any other seat in the economy cabin as the legroom is really nonexistent I tried it and together with the lack of width it makes for a combination from hell My travel partner is 172m and even he found it extremely difficult Moreover a crew member on

was able to fall asleep for at least 5 on both legs and the TV inflight service was excellent The only annoying part of the flight was the fact that the inflight box is situated in the seat underneath

This is for window seats row A All the window seats and in K too seemed to have this same problem As a result you either have to sit diagonally with both legs on the left side or do the splits with a leg on each side but the problem with this is that the left legs calf muscle will have the corner of the foot rest jar up into the muscle causing pain after some time Also when fully reclined it is

simply was not enough room to fit my bones between the seats so I had to splay my legs outwards On the outward aisle side my leg could not fit under the arm rest which is fixed and cannot move up so it was digging into the top of my leg all the time On the inside my leg was now in my sons seat space and my feet could not get under the seat due to the box on the floor My son is also over 190m so he was already experiencing similar issues without me using his leg room All this was without the person in front reclining their seat We tried to lift the armrests to collectively give us more space but they only go to about 45 degrees as they simply cannot fit between the seats at chest height so these were at best under my armpits Third issue just sitting in the seat my shoulder was touching my sons shoulder pure and simply the seats are only as wide as a person nothing more Fourth issue if my wife or son wanted to go to the toilet they had to climb over me to get out Not ideal but if were not family this is extremely unpleasant for everyone involved Bottom line this is the worst long haul flight I have ever made with KLM or any airline come to that This has never happened to me before outside of one other also with KLM experience on a short haul flight 2 hours but for an intercontinental flight of 10 hours this is terrible Economy means budget and therefore maybe some discomfort but it should never result in physical pain to anyone or offensive intrusion of one passengers legs into another passengers seat space In my 25 years flying with KLM this problem has only got worse but became critical around the time KLM merged with Air France KLMs relationship with it is passengers has deteriorated to one of simply money  everyone buys a basic seat but if you are tall or not thin then we KLM know you will probably pay even more to get a slightly better seat There is no concept of building a long term relationship with customers or meeting their needs so long as we make a few bucks out of you we are happy even though we know you are not Extremely short sighted and selfish attitude from a long time national carrier that should know and aspire to something better KLM may think all its customers look at is the bottom line and that cheap is the name of the game but if that is the case then why do they offer lots of seats at extra expense to avoid incredibly bad seat conditions It might surprise you to learn that if I am going to have to pay a bit more to get a better seat then I had be prepared to pay it up front to guarantee seat quality and comfort That

legroom on outward flight As soon as we sat down realized that these seats were narrower than the standard seats due to the fact that the entertainment remote is attached to the side of the seat

would have stayed in 14A That said I watched a film directly after the meal service the second Narnia film and then woke up just before breakfast So I must have slept for about eight hours Perhaps the

uncomfortable thing I have experienced Everything was narrow the seat the aisle the virtually nonexistant legroom the food tray It was hell trying to get any sleep as there was very little space in which to move around to change positions The only remotely comfortable way of getting any sleep was by reclining the seat when the person next to you was not reclining theirs And the seat did not recline much I have had better reclining seats in local buses Theb other issue was the food tray it was narrow although it fitted everything served However dinner time was an issue since there was not enough room for everyone to eat comfortably without knocking down your own stuff or the stuff of the person next to you In short quite an uncomfortable experience I endured both a short flight and a tenhour flight and they were both hell', 'Despite being an advanced airplane the Boeing 787 Economy seat at LOT is not the best IFE is good table is smart but the legroom is limited and seats are very

boxes attached to the floor right under the seat in front of you which reduced your legroom even more Initially I got bulkhead seat 18F in the 4seat row If you think the regular seats are narrow wait until you see the bulkhead ones Because the armrests are fixed your legs are literally squeezed I looked behind me and there was a vacant middle seat to which I moved right before take off But that did not do it either I called the staff to ask for an upgrade to the Premium Class but it cost 399 euros So my colleague who had an aisle seat on the same row was nice enough to trade places with me so I could have a little more room But sleeping is out of question on such seats I practically got no sleep at all just like some passengers whod rather stand up during the whole flight than being squeezed on a seat Food was nice and so was the crew but I vow never to flight coach on Lufhansa again', 'Shanghai to Frankfurt The Lufthansa A380 Economy Class is pretty good The legroom is good and

surprised', 'The seats look fancy but do not offer any comfort and especially no lumbar support at all Plus the distance between the seat rows is very narrow especially if one is just little bit

bottle of water basically disappeared over the years', 'Munich to LAX  40c A very large passenger in the seat ahead of me kept her seat in full recline throughout the flight making it near impossible for me to eat or exit the seat Also because of the fixed aisle armrest I literally needed to climb into my seat in order to step out into the aisle This also put the monitor so close to my face that eye strain kept me from using the entertainment system to get a break from the torture I will never again fly nonstop from Europe to the west coast of the US The crew was friendly', 'I was fortunate

was ok by the money you put in the ticket But this time I was excited to try the brand new 7478 thinking it would be more spacious and comfortable than the old 400s My mistake The truth is they shrank the space in the coach class and created a more spacious Business and First Class More than half of the 747s main deck is dedicated to First and Business while 262 coach passengers are squeezed on the rear I am 180m tall and it was very difficult to me to find a nice position to rest and relax Absolutely no sleeping during the 11 hours flight To make it even worse the flight was completely full The

second row of Economy seats now the reason for the extra legroom is the fact that the plane layout goes from a 2x3x2 to a 2x4x2 in row 27 Seat G is basically halfway in the aisle however the rest of the row is god awful because the seats are not perfectly aligned and therefore every seat has immovable armrests for tray tables but the video screens are still on the seat in front giving a very crooked view Honestly it is the most aggravating thing Another huge reason for the low score is the bathrooms Lufthansa has a neat little feature where they place all economy bathrooms downstairs on the bottom deck This is really cool however there are only 5 of them The flight attendants also have to guard the stairs to make sure that crowding does not occur They vigilantly stand guard and make sure a line of no more than 5 people forms which happens rather quickly Almost impossible to use the restroom', 'For seat 21ABHJ you have to pay an extra 6000 Euros No window as on row 20 also If you

to sleep', 'While Lufthansa has better leg room than most it is not great and sleep in is just awkward However the A380 does give much more luggage space above the seats so you can avoid putting things under the seat in front which is better The seats have an ethernet jack and USB port but NO power sockets Wifi is available at a small price but using Wifi uses much more battery power in your laptop Unless you are very lucky with battery life having no power socket is a serious disadvantage especially for cost conscious business travelers  but then again Lufthansa would like to see those in Business class anyway which is not always possible This negates the advantage of having Wifi available The inflight entertainment system has an OK range of films and programmes You can normally find 45 hours of viewing from the selection The system however is quite slow and the touchscreens very temperamental If you want more then bring a tablet computer with a long battery life loaded with films and avoid Wifi The upside of Lufthansa is excellent service from cabin crew who seem to be constantly available if you need help', 'Toronto to Frankfurt return Like sitting on a kitchen chair

having his seat fully reclined making the viewing of the seat monitor difficult because it was just too close 12 hours of being squeezed into a configuration which left me feeling compelled to take a

feet Really annoying if there are carryons stuffed down there Why do I rate high These are the only seats I can sit in for 10 hours and my ass not get sore or fall asleep No need for awkward shuffling around to get some circulation going Maybe it is the padding maybe it is because the equipment is new or maybe because Recaro really knows how to make seats Either way I like them Not included in the rating is the service Outstanding Not the standard drink meal drink meal service They offer lots of drinks And when it is nap time aboard and the lights dimmed a little counter by the galley is

not much change compared to old 747400 What is more the annoying metal box of IFE was present under the window seat something similar to a340600 Overall the seats are not worse than other airlines  in this manner they can be recommended but do not expect too much', 'Lufthansas regional seat is very good Whilst the actual stated pitch does not sound great they have really thought about how to maximise legroom the safety and shopping guides are placed high up the seat in front and the seat is somehow very thin and very comfortable Obviously there was no IFE and we only got a snack and an

target the first row in Economy class on outer two seats', 'Singapore  Kuala Lumpur  Auckland Return Boarding was delayed There were many Indian nationals onboard which resulted with many special meals vegetarians etc However many of them preferred to switch seats which made meal service very frustrating for the crews plus it was a full load flight I do not blame them I sat on the left aisle towards the back of the plane Recline was minimal but that did not stop me from sleeping It was an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Auckland There were no flight map indication on the IFEs so I had no idea where we were flying throughout the entire flight Food was not worth talking about I do not really care for it I am thankful I had a considerate neighbour next to me who scooched towards the window while he sleeps leaving me a little bit more space Legroom wise it was ok I am 185m tall and my legs fit snugly in the seat However there is more than enough space when I straighten my legs underneath the seat Pretty much slept the entire journey The plane was looking real tired Really no qualms about it other than the rest of the passengers who are rude and taking the crews for granted So if you are flying with MH have little to no expectations whatsoever they have will surprise you if any I just booked a flight from Singapore  Kuala Lumpur  Sydney return for December This time it will be on their Airbus planes Well see', 'Went from MAAKULLGK via MAS and the seats were really good I do not know what it is made out of but its pretty comfortable The seat had a pretty good legroom for a 737 type aircraft The PTV had good options the food was also good Only at KULLGK flight the same 737 they do not serve meal because it is a short 55 minutes flight but you do get small refreshments which is good enough to me The PTV worked but no headsets and that was during KULLGK But the PTV was locked during LGKKUL Will surely recommend this airline', 'Seats were uncomfortable with little padding over the new plastic seats and no lumbar support to speak of The recline of the seat in front meant it was impossible to get out from your seat without hanging on to the seat in front at an awkward angle Leg room was impacted by a metal box entertainment system so that your right leg could not be stretched out An exceedingly uncomfortable long haul flight', 'Seats are too crowded and leg room is non existent I am 188m which is not unusually tall and knees are constantly in the tray of seat in front Cant recline all the way because it annoys the person behind I tolerate

possible for this reason', 'BUDHAMGVA Seats are probably alright for medium to short pax weighing less than 60kg Seats so narrow and close to the window and aisle seat as to be extremely uncomfortable

placed vertically except for to and landing Service food and beverages were superior to the average SWISS flight but the LH CR900 would be better suited to a 1x2 seating arrangement', 'In the upper deck the 2x4x2 configuration worked well There was adequate legroom and a reasonable seat recline Row 40 has limited recline due to the toilets There was toilet noise towards the back of the cabin', 'Seat has infinite leg room and has no obstructions to the front This means that it is the only window seat that is also an aisle seat However the tray table is the bulkhead variety and is flimsy The table slopes towards the left hand side when loaded This is a problem when eating during turbulence as any liquid will almost certainly slide off the tray  this happened to me The seat area is very draughty and cold  maybe just the bad flight I was on The distance between the seat and the window is large meaning several pillows are required to bridge the gap and support your head I do not

levels of Qantas frequent flyer', 'The economy class on Qantas could only be described as cattle class I had a window seat and had no access whatever to the aisle I had to wait 12 hours of a 14 hour flight to use the toilet as the persons in the seats next to me were both asleep I found the seat to be hard uncomfortable and seriously in need of further adjustment When paying an honest fare you expect honest comfort not to be penned in like cattle and whoever designed the seats for Qantas seriously needs further education in ergonomics', 'This was the worst economy class seat I have had the misfortune to be seated in The legroom was less than the standard planes if the person in front of you had their seat reclined you could not use your tray table and it really felt like your space was being invaded I would have thought with the A380 you would have been given a little more room but this was certainly not the case The staff were miserable the service inefficient food was disgusting The only good thing was that I was only on the plane for 7 hours I would not recommend the Qantas A380 plane of service  pay more get more', 'London to Sydney on QF2 an A380 service I had seat 36F an economy aisle seat on the Upper Deck It turned out to be the worst seat I have encountered in over 20 years of longhaul flying The problem was that there was a boxlike structure containing who knows what mechanism immediately under the seat in front of me which meant that I had leg room in the most literal sense  room for one leg Fine for children or those missing a left leg lousy for anyone else I might add that I had more leg room on my 40 minute connecting flight to Canberra in Economy on a 737800 than for the 12 hours flight from London to Singapore I put up with it during the LondonSingapore leg but mentioned my dissatisfaction to some crew members not long into the SingaporeSydney leg To their credit they were extremely sympathetic and helpful went looking for another seat and moved me to 48A downstairs an exit row which was very much better', 'I only travel Business or First on International flights usually using miles This was my third experience with an international airlines Premium Economy offering I paid  for this flight and am very happy that I did I found the 15 hour flight from DFW to BNE very good the service was as good as I have had in QF Business I was able to sleep was looked after fed and airplane was clean', 'Food not great  settled for bread and cheese My legs were cramped on the final leg Singapore Ã¢\\x80\\x93 Sydney  knees pushed against seat in front which meant I could not rest my head Flight staff not pleasant on final leg Chaotic flight staffing on first leg  it was like a mad house  people asking to be reseated insufficient overhead locker space someone took up our luggage space before we boarded Biggest problem  we did not sleep well Cant blame Qantas but one chap sat next to me snored like a pig throughout the flight  I lost a full nights sleep  the stewards were aware but what could they do When table and TV screen in place it was like sitting in a steel box Need to look at an angle when looking at TV screen  screen pulls out from seat rather than located directly in front The worst part of the journey was the reclining seat in front When fully reclined it was impossible to use my tray and virtually impossible for my wife to leave her central seat All in all an unpleasant experience when compared with Premium Economy with Air New Zealandked onto an A380 again unless I win the lottery and can go first class probably not going to happen', 'LAX to Sydney The economy A380 seats are a disgrace The backs are thinner making every movement and touch from behind felt immediately The seats recline beautifully  except the lovely recline means you are lying in someones lap and someone is probably lying in your lap This makes sitting up and reading impossible if the person in front of you goes to sleep before you do The entertainment screen is also too close to see clearly as soon the seat in front of you is reclined Lucky for me the gentleman in front of me was asked to raise his seat back so I could eat The seats themselves are barely wide enough to sit in There is less leg room than any other flight I have been on in my life To eat requires the capacity to keep ones arms glued to ones sides while wielding a fork and knife so one is not elbow jousting with the neighbor The tray table is so small it barely fits the tiny food tray which is all of about 9 x 5 inches The entertainment screen remote is tucked away in the arm between the seats so you have to ask the person next to you to move his arm to retrieve it Then you have to slam the armrest lid down on the attached cord without breaking it I just kept the remote out and hanging off the edge of my seat so I did not have to bother that poor guy again The armrests also do not raise all the way so if you are fortunate enough to have an empty seat next to you you cannot get rid of it and stretch out a bit more or rest your head against the next seatI weigh 100 lbsabout 47 kg I am thin and not tall This seat was uncomfortable for me Now imagine what it is like for any normal human I will keep flying Qantas but I will never be booked onto an A380 again unless I win the lottery and can go first class probably not going to happen', 'Heathrow  Singapore  Brisbane Seat number 69d was comfortable and plenty of room even though I am 63 The room is a little limited if the person in front reclines as then you have to to use the ife but over all found the journey very good and I even got some sleep', 'Seat 38J and K in premium economy are an exit row seat and have no one behind you However Qantas are changing the configuration of the A380 and these seats will be come part of a multi row economy cabin on the upper deck Getting in and out of these seats is a doddle The recline is great and the seat comfy My only disappointment was that the leg rest did not extend far enough I guess that is because if there was a seat in front of me it would have been in the way If I have the money I had fly PE again but Qantas does not seem to offer it on my route once the Emirates tie in comes into effect', '60K on a 3class 747 is a bulkhead While the seat was as comfortable as the A380 I made the mistake of selecting the bulkhead It is great as know one is in front of you but there is no cut out for your feet I know understand why people put their feet on the bulkhead I wished I had chosen a standard seat in the end Its not cramped and if you are upright its fine but if you recline and want to stretch your legs you cannot  Trade off I guess between that and no one in front of you Made it easy to get out from the window seat', 'Standard Economy Seat on a full flight and found it really comfortable I flew Singapore Airlines a couple of years ago and found the seat did not seem recline enough but here it was great I think the base slides forward which helped I was not overly fussed with the net foot rest I would prefer a bar instead However I managed to sleep which really surprised me as I do not normally sleep in economy I had fly Qantas again but their new tie up with Emirates means my route does not have any easy option anymore', 'This review is for economy seat 48A which is an exit seat if it were a normal seat it would be much lower score LondonSingaporeMelbourne I think this is one of the best seats to get in economy You are the last to board and the first to get off The seat is a window seat so you have the storage thing on the wall to your left to put things in where as if you were 48B or 48C you would have no where It has part of the door sticking out in front of your left leg so if your over 60 you cannot really stretch your leg out fully I am 64 and did not have a problem with this as you can angle both legs to one side and not obstruct the person to your right and it was intrusive either and the best thing is this seat only cost 25 to book compared to the 160180 they charge for the other extra leg room seatsexit seats including the two next to you People say the seats are bad and in August I said this myself I felt they were too hard but for some reason it was fine this time almost like the cushions have been replaced and I really enjoyed the ride If flying on an A380 with 31 or less leg room like Qantas you will want to book a better seat as passengers behind you have no room and can hardly see the TVs quite ridiculous The seats recline too much I think a better foot rest would be better than 2 extra recline', 'I was seated in seat 70G row 70 is 3x3x3 and is the only row in economy that is like this The leg rests are unusable recline is good and the seat moves as well as the back to improve comfort Overall the seats were pretty good', 'This is the second flight I have taken with Qatar Airways from Edinburgh to Cape Town I found this the best airline I have travelled with I travel wheelchair assistance and found the staff friendly and very helpful The aircraft is lovely and TV screen good leg room good food good and the fresh coffee was the best  I would give them 5 stars', 'Excellent comfortable seats I actually slept the whole flight which I have failed to do on other airlines', 'I have just completed 8 flights with Qantas and half of them including the B747 were like torture I am quite tall and cannot afford to buy the extralegroom seats I joined their frequent flyer programme in the hope of getting aisle seats but that did not work These flights were the tightest for legroom of any of the very many airlines I have used Knees hard up against the seat in front with no chance of any movement  even worse when the seat in front recliners On an 8 or 13 hour flight it is hardly bearable Will not fly with them again', 'Flew LAX to SYD on A380 seat 56H aisle seat Get to my seat and find that something is wrong with my earphone jack so only get sound in 1 ear The armrest does not raise up completely so no one can lean on each other The leg room itself was okay but nothing fantastic I am 65 tall and no matter what it is never going to be great I worked out how to move my legs to get maximum space Flight attendants poor performance by fussing over pseudo celebrities on the flight and not caring much for anyone else Will avoid Qantas if possible in the future Disappointing experience', 'Traveled with my husband and son on the A380 flying from SYD  LAX return using the A380 both ways flying economy Very poor seats on the A380 They were hard and not comfortable at all The seat width was the same width as the Virgin Australia domestic plane and the leg rest was almost impossible to use if the person in front of you reclined their seat And once they do recline you cannot get your bag from off the floor and it is almost impossible to get out of your chair Its almost as bad as flying the domestic Qantas planes', 'Comfortable seat decent legroom good inflight entertainment screen The only letdown was that the armrests could only be raised to about 60 degrees', 'The seat is comfortable because has a support for the head The pitch is good comfortable for the legs The best is the screen in each seat big with many movies musics series tv shows etc', 'Very narrow seats flew out on QR2 and it was full and felt claustrophobic even though I was in the aisle Came back on the A330 and seats were much wider Qatar Airways are very goodjust do not fly on their 787', 'QANTAS promotes the A380 as their flagship what a bitter disappointment the service and food quality was good economy class seating was cramped cushioning comfortable and reasonably supportive there was no additional room to store reading matter Ipad or glasses The entertainment system was excellent Getting from the window seat to the aisle required the other 2 passengers to move from their seats to be stuck in this situation for 12 hours is inhuman the plane was fully occupied In future I will become more selective in choosing the carrier who provides the best seat pitch on long haul flights', 'Seat 35a I am tall 63 and longlegged so it is vital I not only have enough legroom but that the seat supports me  I am also reasonably skinny so cannot take a hard seat There are no exit seats on Qantas 747 Premium Economy only regular seats bulkhead seats and seats with back to bulkhead 35a is the window seat second row in  I have to say the legroom is terrific no risk of banging my knees  also I could fully stretch my legs under the seat in front which I would not have been able to do with the bulkhead seat And the recline is very good though I believe less so if your seat backs onto the bulkhead row 37 Only downside is you share loos with Economy Noise cancelling headphones are good but the AVOD system is looking dated  A380 is much better Foot rest is useless for taller people  they would be better off having an additional bar to flip out under the seat in front Seat width is more than adequate for me being a narrow girth It is not business class  you have to pay alot more for that  but you do get treated more individually than in economy  and Premium Economy being a small cabin it feels more individual  Qantas get a big thumbs up from me for the overall experience', 'DOHPHL economy on B777200LR Excellent seats comparable to the ones in Emirates A380', 'I was looking forward to a comfortable ride since the 787 is a new aircraft and Qatar Airways is a quality airline I had very little space for my feet and had to sit in an uncomfortable position to fit Also the reading lights were pointed at you and not on your newspaper which made reading in the dark impossible I will not book a flight with Qatar Airways 787 again The connecting flight I had with Qatar Airways A380 was a pure dream by comparison', 'PerthLondon return the 777 for 3 of the 4 flights 37A and then 28C and 27C I think the seat size on all was generous  probably the widest I have sat in The recline is incredible not good though if you want to sit upright and the one in front reclines I was lucky to have no one next to me on 2 of the 4 flights so plenty of room Also feet room was good no box could stretch right out Only thing that bugged me was the touch screen Didnt work well on both return flights had to end up trying to navigate with the touch pad a tad frustrating Would book again', 'Hong Kong to Melbourne with no TV unit at all I was told nothing could be done about it Nine hours of sitting in a seat with nothing to do The attendants kept offering me drinks which I thought was odd especially after they advise to keep alcohol consumption to a minimum What made it worse was that I paid extra for the seat I was in a total waste of money', 'The most comfortable economy flight I have had The 787 is much less comfortable But on both aircraft the staff provided exceptional service This is my new favourite economy airline I had been a Qantas devotee but this surpasses it by miles', 'Qatar Airways A380 Doha to Paris 26 Nov 2014 Economy seat 31G upper deck In their brand new A380 Qatar

similar to a budget airline', 'The seats are tight in CoachEconomy although the added touches already on your seat when boarding were nice  blanket and pillow as well as headphones and a toothbrush

not to move seats and before we landed at LAX the First AttendantPurser visited my seat and gave me some gifts and an apology for the inconvenience I thought that was quite generous of him', 'Sydney to London on the A380 paid 20 extra to get an exit row seat in order to get extra leg room seat 66D as I am over 6ft 2 tall My main issue with the seats are that there was hardly any thickness to the bottom cushion of the seat so this made for a numbing 235 hours so much so that I was hardly able to sleep at all during the entire flight I estimate that there was approximately only 25 inches of padding between the top to the mesh metal base of the seat The B747 on the outgoing leg of the journey was a lot more bearable Whoever gave these seats a Design Award must have had no sense feeling from the waist down or actually sat in them for a very short period of time The only reason why I would recommend this seat would be for the extra leg room apart from that it is a very uncomfortable experience', 'Avoid to travel with this type of airplane from Qatar airways fleet The Qatar Airways Boeing 777 or A330 are more comfortable', 'The economy seat reclines a bit further than many others Not a good thing for the passenger behind who either has their tv screen far too close to their face or anything on their table is dumped into their lap when the seat is reclined It happened to 2 people on my flight and very nearly to me', 'One of the best economy class seats I know I am 59 and legroom was more than enough Recline was better than most airlines Screen had a pretty wide adjustment angle so I had no problem to watch the program regardless of how reclined was the seat in front of me At the meal time there was enough room to use the tray table without the passenger in front putting their seat in the upright position Good choice of entertainment the only downside was that the seat was a little hard Summing it up a very good overall experience', 'Manchester  Doha  Singapore The A330 was quite comfortable enough legroom The B787 seats are narrow and too close together you struggle to get in and out of them The entertainment box situated under the seat restricts your legroom by about 13rd', 'Once the passenger in front reclined his seat fully it was in my face and I had difficulty getting up from my seat or moving let alone trying to collect my bag from under the front seat which was impossible My husband moved to a free seat beside him which gave me 2 but as seats are concave and armrest does not push up fully out of the way was impossible for me to take advance of 2 seats on a 13hr night flight The new A380 seating has me now looking to other airline options for long international flights', 'I fly to and from London from Melbourne about 10 times a year and try to fly premium economy or business as much as I can With the introduction of the A380 I expected Qantas to improve seating in both cabins Unfortunately not The Premium Economy seat is OK but why would Qantas decide it should be at the back of the upper deck There is very limited overhead storage especially for people with full size roll on bags Being at the back on the plane there is far more lateral movement and it is very noticeable so in comparison to the 747 Premium economy I found myself less comfortable due to the bumping around had to shunt by carry on luggage in a different location to where I was and we were one of the later ones off the plane meaning a longer wait in the dreaded passport control The food was pretty ordinary as well I can never understand that these flights are always full yet Qantas bleats about struggling to make ends meet and keeps dropping the quality of services', 'I am a short guy and the experience was unbearable for me The seats are slim without much foam for back support The legroom is impeached by the entertainment box attached to the seat with make seating straight impossible even for my short legs The aisle seats inconvenience are the entertainment box and the reduced aisle which will provide you a bumpy ride from other passing passengers or carts If you think the middle seat is your saver When you recline the seat is move forward which turn your knee as an entertainment tv stand I would advise that you fly Qatar Airways Airbus or Boeing 777 where comfort is very satisfactory', 'That was one of the best you could ever get on a longhaul flight I was worrying about the seat before the flight because I am 59 and a quite heavy weight But once I got seated there was still space between me and the bar and the legrooms were still lots left', 'Cramped economy seat made particularly uncomfortable as entertainment system takes up considerable space in the foot well Have to sit with legs at an angle to avoid the box Exceptionally uncomfortable flight', 'Qatar B777 long haul MELDOH experience was good One of the better economy seats plus good service However the new B787 DOHBRU return horrible Main problem is the entertainment system box which intrudes into legroom for A C D F G and K seat It occupies about one third of the space directly in front of the seat On one sector the middle seat was empty so sitting on an angle made it almost tolerable but on the return the middle seat was occupied and I had to squeeze my foot between the seat support and the curved sidewall Other Qatar flights maybe but if it involves a connection in DOH to a 787 forget it', 'Seated in 80A from MELSIN fantastic leg room as no seat in front of you and not an exit row so you do not have to pay for it Family member was sitting in 80B and for economy seat this was pretty standard compared to other airlines besides for the fact there is a net to place you feet in under the seat in front This makes it feel you have more leg room and is pretty comfortable When seats recline the whole seat moves with you including the bottom part so this makes the seat seem to recline a bit more', 'This Boeing 787 has the narrowest seats I have seen in some time Be prepared to knock your elbows with your copassenger or if they are of large built they will spill over in your seat Compared to the A330 seats of Qatar

again', 'The leg room on this plane was what stood out for me The seat was a bit hard but you get a pillow and a blanket to compensate The inflight entertainment had many recent films of different genres to choose from good amount of seat width and a good seat recline The food served in my opinion was fantastic with usually an asian option or western dish The bigger windows on the 787 were amazing you get a fantastic view whilst not compromising the view of the other passengers', 'BWNDXBLHRDXBBWN a long 175 hour flight the entertainment was a little bit outdated But the seat I liked but

were not clear in advertising it was only for the Premium Economy Seats I found that the A380 was an uncomfortable flight as when the person in front reclines you are left hardly any leg room also

until I boarded and realised I had a premium economy seat These seats are very comfortable and I enjoyed the extra seat width and elbow room Service was fantastic and because we were seated directly behind PE the drinks cart was not too far away The seat itself is nice good recline compared to regular economy and not knocking elbows is good TV and table all located in arm rests and easily accessible As I had the window side of the seats there is the ability to squeeze shoes pillow between seat and wall Only let down is lack of storage so accessing booksmagazines or toiletries I needed

though nicely served on linen china etc Staff were excellent on three of the four legs We were addressed by name on several occasions by smiling crew On SYDSIN leg the Customer Services Manager walked around and met everyone in the cabin shook hands and thanked us for flying with Qantas then repeated this as we approached SIN Premium Economy cabin is quite close to the tail so lateral movement is quite noticeable during turbulence IFE is firstclass touch screen intuitive interface and loads of choice First time I have taken more than a passing interest Only disappointment was that the screen has to be stowed during takeoff and landing  precisely when the Skycam in the tail is at its most entertaining so you cannot watch that part of the proceedings And finally beware  while these two seats are the best in the cabin for legroom they are also the chilliest This may be because they are near the galley which has to be cooled or it may be that it is next to the door  though I cannot believe this would be the cause of a draught In any case it was much warmer a few rows forward and we had to cover up well in the excellent blankets to avoid the worst of it and still there was an uncomfortably cool draught on our faces This was true on both trips both A380s but different aircraft So while I had recommend Premium Economy I am not sure this is the best place to sit The ultimate measure is that my wife suffered a lot less from her usual terminal jetlag weve done this trip quite a lot and said she would do it again which is not true of standard Economy theres no going back to

not have to pay anything at all  given that there was the section over the door sticking out which would result in my legs being slight angled but not in the way of the passenger next to me Well worth

suggest you get in early and book an upper deck seat The cabin is much quieter than the main deck making it easier to sleep etc on long trips The aircraft appeared to be new and was very clean and tidy inside As for the seating itself economy class is not as comfortable as I expected with the seats feeling somewhat smaller and more cramped then the cozy older generation seats in the SQ B777200 that flies from Singapore to Manila The entertainment system food customer service however were all excellent on all my SQ flights Being a rather small asian framed person I think it would be quite difficult for a 6ft European to travel long distances in the SQ A380 economy class but I doubt any other carriers would offer anything better without having to pay for business class In terms of seat width legroom and access these seats felt no better than the Jetstar A330 that also flies MelbourneSingapore All in all I would probably take SQ again on my next business trip to Asia given their competitive pricing at the moment SQ is at least 300 cheaper than Philippine Airlines when travelling between Aus and Phil Changi airport is always a pleasure to use and as mentioned before the

'Singapore Airlines split my family up despite booking several months in advance for a round trip from Heathrow to Singapore The plane is quiet and food was quite good too I thought the seating was poor because it is obviously designed with no thought to Westerners that are tall or full bodied and seat legroom is worse than other airlines The service from the cabin crew was clinical and without a smile most of the time In future I will not use Singapore Airlines', 'I got the last seat on the plane furthest back Avoid this seat at all cost  no seat recline at all Conclusion unless you are in first or business class go somewhere else and do not pay a premium for a company which in fact does not provide you any extra service  experience', 'Similar to some earlier comments the seats were really hard unlike SQs 777300ER that I normally flew The only advantage of flying this A380 is you notice less noise on the cabin The mood lighting was not that great because it was set only to red and orange LED all the time My seat was on the upper deck with less seats and less people I think it is always better to choose such seats Being seated at the last two rows nearby the toilet 82E might not be really pleasant due to the smell', 'The new SQ seats are hard I fly regularly the SINParis leg on Economy and after 56 hours my rear is just numb I have to get up to let the blood flow Not only is the seat hard but the extremely limited incline of the backrest only allows your back to rest in a technically still sitting position And that is hard for a 1213 hour journey I do not understand how SQ could have gotten this part so wrong', 'B777300ER AKLSIN and B777200ER SINDEL The 777200 Economy Class seat was nice and square shaped meaning that it was not narrow like the new Singapore

not recline my seat because of children seated behind Once the seat in front is reclined the space is even more restricted and stepping out of your seat proved more challenging If I can help it will

shifted back several cm As a result row 37 and row 38 have much much less legroom My knees were pressing into the seat back of row 36 for the entire trip 14 hours and the situation was made much worse by the fact that the person seated in 36A jammed the seat all the way back as far as she could giving me even less leg room My seat mate was a large tall gentlemen and he suffered far more than I did For both of us the seats in row 37 were claustrophobic Couple that with the fact that both seats in row 36 have boxes under them that restrict the amount of room people in row 37 have to stretch their

service has declined within the last 18 years Find the new A380 economy seats incredibly hard and uncomfortable with poor pitch and lousy legroom for long journeys far prefer the old seats SQ heats the cabin more than comfortably Seem to offer the same food for the same route month after month after month Far too popular so no longer can get choice of seats better value for money out there', 'I am 64 which is the only reason I am giving the seat a fair rating It was at least as good as I expected and if I had not had my kids with me I could have gone for a preferred seat at a very low extra of 50Be prepared to do lots of sideway sitting and stretching if you are 6 plus SQ experience more than compensated for any legroom shortage though', 'Upper Deck  Paid extra to book 71A  C which have no seats in front of them While this is good there is limited a small locker usually filled with blankets or other equipment to no overhead storage and you either have to place your cabin bags in lockers further back making them difficult to retrieve inflight and on landing or hope the crew will place them in the crew cupboard in the bulkhead area some are happy to and some are not There is no window at these seats and also no side storage bins Most significantly the seats are next to the bulkhead section where the baby bassinets are located there were one or more screaming babies on each leg It may be advisable to go with similar seats further back where you may only have people milling around waiting for the toilets', 'Had seat 59K last row window I found the B777 seats more comfortable width and padding than those of the A380 With no seat behind you can put the seat back at any time without worrying about others behind you The bulkhead section nearby houses a galley no toilets and while there is some noise it tends only to be noticeable at meal service times As the last 2 rows are only 2abreast there is only one person to get past when getting out of your seat I tend to prefer a window on longhaul as I have a broad upper body and so always tend to get bumped into by passersby on the aisle', 'A380 LHR SIN and return Upper Deck Seats 71 A and C These are preferred seats and need to be booked in advance on the SIA website for a charge of 50 per sector Well worth the extra as there is no one in front of you and the emergency exit does not intrude from the side as it does on a 747 I think these are actually better that the exit seats further back on the upper deck as no one came up and stood in front of us on either flight whereas further back people milled around waiting for the toilet The toilets next to our seats were for business class and curtained off so no one came to look out of the window from there Seat was OK on the outward journey but felt quite hard and was somewhat uncomfortable towards the end of the return flight This was probably because I had already sat on a 777200ER for 10 hours with very hard seats Flight felt quite hot on the way back although there were several people with blankets and jumpers so it may just have been me I did discover 2 fresh air vents around the emergency exit door which improved matters considerably so it is worth looking for these A380 noticably quieter that the 777 Food and service excellent as was the AVOD I woulld certainly choose this airlineaircraftseat in the future if at all possible', 'The economy class seats on the A380 are extremely hard  almost unbearably so for a long haul flight Based on the hardness of the seats alone I would not fly on this aircraft again We paid an extra charge to sit at the front of the upper deck economy cabin  do not waste your money  the aircraft windows are not aligned to these seats there is no side storage bin no above storage making it inconvenient to store items for take off and landing and no footrests The only advantage is it is easier to get up from your seat Service was not great for Singapore Airlines  and the hard seat  awful', 'The footrest makes it hard to stretch your feet out underneath the seat in front of you also there is a bar underneath the seat in front of you making it hard to get your legs comfortable', 'SIA 777200ER SINAKL and CHCSIN all the SAI 777200 planes to New Zealand are the ER type Seat pitch was good The problem was the hardness of the seat and a ridge running accross it The padding was very thin at the back and probably old and compressed I pulled the seat cushion up to have a look and there is a pneumatic cushion at the front of the seat so that you can change the thigh support via a small button on the front left of the seat cushion operating a valve There is also a similar pneumatic lumbar support The problem was firstly the hardness of the seat and secondly the junction between the foam and this pneumatic cushion which caused a ridge that cut into my upper thighs The overall result is a very uncomfortable seat Both flights had the full AVOD system which was nice and service was good but not as good as on the A380 as was the food The seat would not put me off flying SIA again as the A380 was good and staying overnight at Changi was excellent 40 minutes from aircraft arriving at the gate to checking in at the airport hotel and fantastic and incredibly cheap food at the food court on B2 level but in future I had try to fly on the 777300ER which I

position Moreover the seat is very narrow forcing you to maintain permanently a straight seating position The seats are not too bad but not sufficiently comfortable for a flight of over 10 hours under these conditions On the return flight there was a box in my legroom underneath the seat in front which took half of my legroom I could only place one foot under the front seat next to the box the

seat is hardly reclining and is one of the worst seats ever experienced on any airline The 15 hour flight was most uncomfortable and sorry after 30 years flying UA cannot recommend this plane If UA do not amend their seating am afraid many loyal UA flyers will seek alternative airlines to the USA', 'One of the worst flights I have ever flown I had to endure 12hours of this misery from Tokyo Narita to Chicago Food was not very good and the comfort level was horrible I strongly recommend not flying on a United 747', 'ORDYVR Like others have mentioned the new seats are awful very hard and uncomfortable on any flight over an hour Leg room was great but after almost 4 hours in this seat it got painful We all want cheap flights but someone must be able to design a less painful cheap seat Also flew a 757 from Dublin that day seats were far more comfortable in that plane', 'NewarkBerlin Tegel 75 hour flight was emptier than most United flights The food was very poor and the seats were very bad The flight was bad', 'I do not know why United even bothers to provide seats at this point Also the sizes of the seatbelts are arbitrary I was in the one seat row going into Newark and there was about an inch gap between the buckle and the insertion side I was unable to maneuver it because when I tried to I hit my head so I asked for an extender While in Newark I became ill and did not eat for two days When I boarded the plane to return I was on the side with two seats The buckle went as far as my naval The side you insert came as far as the side of my leg You probably think I weigh 400 pounds Nowhere near My heart really goes out to others  I do not know how they coped I am never taking United again They disrespect people All they care about is how many people they can stuff into their horrible planes', 'The new United seats are terrible While they look sleek and modern there are extremely uncomfortable for any duration of flight I have status with Air Canada but fly United while in the States United made a mistake investing in these seats because it is only going to push business travelers and new travelers away With the flexibility to choose airlines in the USA I would strongly urge United to not invest any more money into this bad idea Shift investment to another style seat that all travelers in business or economy would feel more comfortable in Just a suggestion but I think all would agree', 'I fly over 35k miles per year with united they upgraded some seats on certain planes and they are the most uncomfortable seats on any airline I fly very hard slippery material so you keep sliding down and I believe they also shortened the length of the seats so more of your thigh is hangout my off Terrible investment United', 'I flew on United Airlines for the first time and it was the worst experience I am a 6 in shape lean guy and my knees were touching the seat in front of me The tray table was impossible and sitting in the those horrible seats made me feel like i was crammed into a sardine box as I was constantly touching the two people on both sides On the way back to Norway it was in impossible to sleep as I could not recline back enough to find a comfortable position', 'I had the most painful 65 hour flight from Newark Liberty to SeaTac due to these horrible seats Everything about them is wrong The seat bottom is too short the seat back is slumped or slouched even when fully upright and forces shortlegged passengers to plant their feet into the floor to keep their hips from sliding forward and grinding their tailbones into the seat The backs recline too far back to be practical in such an absurdly tightpacked cabin and will interfere with use of tray tables and hurt the knees of tall passengers unfortunate enough to sit behind a reclined seat The armrests are far too low to be useful at all and dig into the thighs of virtually any averagesized adult These seats are good only for illegal forms of enhanced interrogation and nothing else three days after this flight I am still sore and have small bruises from the crap armrest digging into my leg I will do anything to avoid this terrible flight in the future A general rule for those looking for good seats Avoid 737s altogether especially the 800900 series since those planes tend to be utterly crammed to the gills Its just getting worse all the time', 'Due to a full flight and I was upgraded to economy plus seat without paying a dime The seat is very hard and uncomfortable The width of seat and legroom are pretty the same as other airlines in us I am assigned a middle seat which is so uncomfortable and I cannot move around and this is so tiny But this is cheap flying HK to SIN with meal and assigned seat and baggage and the best timing for this shuttle flight I would suggest to take Asian airlines', 'Being a Former Star Alliance airline I expected the seating to be a lot more than it was The seats had the same feeling as a ride in a taxi with that easy to clean material on the seat The Recline was okay there was no power outlet which really ticked me off on the A319 as my phone was dying Legroom was mediocre and the width and aisle space was standard My bag was forced to be Gate Checked on the 319 as there was in adequate storage onboard I didnt have my Carry On Bag during my layover in Philly which was disappointing as I had a change of clothes incase it was humid  which it very much was ', 'Flew PHL to TLV Seats would not recline more than a couple of inches Impossible to fall asleep on the 10 hours flight Would not fly this route again on the Airbus 330', 'We were completely outraged that we paid nonrefundable fees of 320 over and above the airfare on our Philadelphia  Lisbon roundtrip flight 79 per person each way for choice seats  and found out that these seats do not provide any extra legroom We made the reasonable assumption that IF a passenger pays that much extra they would receive what other airlines provide  several inches of additional legroom We did not click through to the description US Airways gives that does say no extra legroom is provided But again paying that much more we made the reasonable assumption that we would receive something more than sitting in the first 3 rows of economy with no additional legroom We fault US Airways for a very misleading offering We will try very hard to avoid flying with them again for this reason PS other passengers in the choice seats were also outraged upon discovering their seats were no less cramped than other economy seats', 'I agree with a previous reviewer who said these seats were torture devices About 2 hours into a flight from Charlotte NC to Phoenix AZ my body was screaming to get out of the seat My poor husband who is quite tall was miserable as well This was one flight I could not wait to get off of it was that bad The seat was hard and confining the leg room stingy The guy behind me continuously hit my seat back doing what I do not know The woman in front of me used her seat back to bounce back and forth throughout the entire flight Why Because they just did not have enough room The space they allot you in your seat is pitiful and painful Twice I had the cart hit my knee as it was pushed by and several times I had people brush up against me as they walked past because there is so little room in the aisle Why is this acceptable for air travel By the time we got off the plane my husbands feet and ankles were severely swollen and he does not normally have a problem with anklefeet swelling Really kind of scary the physical abuse you have to tolerate in order to fly from one part of the country to the other I cannot imagine flying on a plane like this on an international flight It would be intolerable unless you are built like an 8 yearold', 'This was by far the most uncomfortable flight that I have been on and I was in one of the worst possible seats 35C Row 35 has three offcenter seats relative to the four seats of row 34 Between the brackets of the seat in front of you and boxes that hold life jackets there is no place to put your feet There was a universal camaraderie in the cabin in suffering passengers of all shapes and sizes People ignored the seat belt signs and milled about the cabin for periods of relief I will never fly US Airways again for international travel', 'Airways A320 from

sit in an exit row seat 23C on CLT FCO but since there was no passageway or galley behind the bulkhead passengers kept climbing across our row and our legs during the entire flight My heart went out to everyone else not sitting in the exit row  it is astonishing how little space there is with these seats', 'This pertains to seat 8B on the A330200 as I think the center section of 4 seats and perhaps the rear section may not offer as much width Seat width was an excellent 185 which greatly aided in comfort even though pitch was only 31 I thought the equipment box under 8a was not overly intrusive and much better than on Continentals B737s I found the seat width great the TV screen quality very good and the food goodenough Overall a pleasant economy seat', 'There was so little leg room that I could not fit without bumping the seat in front of me And I am only 58 tall 150 lbs There was not even room for a small purse by my feet because of the box they had fitted underneath for the live vests The passenger in front of me could not recline because my knees dug into his back It is criminal that they think this is acceptable on a transatlantic 10 hour flight Do not buy a ticket on their airline until they take out two rows from their configuration', 'For an 8 hour flight from FRA to CLT the seat was unacceptable admittedly I am 67 tall Ground staff was extremely unhelpful regarding a seat change and I was forced to spend an additional 500 to buy an upgrade to Business Class The seat is an insult to passengers', 'Flight from Philadelphia to Manchester UK Have flown to

Airways if you want to fly in comfort', 'Add one more to the list of those who find USAirways A330 coach class seats incredibly uncomfortable As others have also stated this was puzzling because our Denver to Philadelphia leg on an A320 was fine I was shocked that our international leg to London offered worse comfort than the domestic leg Makes no sense I should point out that I am the type who almost never complains about anything and can usually cope with discomfort or inconvenience I am also relatively tall at 60 but not unusually so yet all the way to London I had to sit at an angle It was impossible for me to fit with my knees pointed straight ahead It was not close either I had to sit at about a 30 degree angle to one side then switch to the other side ad nauseum By the time we arrived I was in serious pain and discomfort I have never experienced seats this close together on any flight anywhere', 'By far the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced We went 1 leg on an Airbus 320  that was great Last leg on the 757  that was horrendous I am only 6 tall but my knees hit the seat in front of me the entire trip There was so little room between that seat and mine that I was not able to use the lap tray for my computer The distance between adjacent seats was minimal so buckling seat belts was an arduous task This plane is probably fine for 1 hour flights but on 78 hour flights it is horrible This plane is billed as 188 passenger it needs to be about 150 to give people an opportunity to relax on their flight', 'Danang to Saigon Ho Chi Minh was operated by an

your face that you are better off turning it off', 'Its been a while since I have flown with Virgin and was rather surprised by the changes I purchased the extra legroom seats and was glad I did The standard economy looked horribly claustrophobic and premium economy did not look much more roomy than the seats I had booked However they did look more comfortable as the new seats feel as if someone forgot to put the padding in However service excellent and the hot meals I had were not bad However the breakfast was a bit disappointing  a yogurt granola and a mini muffin The afternoon tea a wrap and a biscuit was good', 'Used seats 78c and 77c which are upstairs and seats are too close together Going out I had all three seats to myself I sat at the window seat and found it extremely difficult to get out  the seats in front are far too close  but I was lucky the other two seats were vacant On the return the plane was full and as I expected one has to get out of your seat to let the two people next to you get outOn a positive note the service was excellent and food good probably because there are less seats upstairs But I will not be flying Virgin again unless they upgrade to newer planes', 'Very fresh and new looking seats of purple leather Ample room in both width and leg room for a short internal flight Seat is more comfortable than a lot of long haul airlines Slight recline pitch but for an internal flight it is more than enough', 'Premium Economy to and from Cuba Seat 18C on flights VS63 and VS64 Cabin service on the outward leg was good and attentive we were told there was a supervisor on board but I was surprised that the space around the seats was extremely confined and that the inflight Ã¢\\x80\\x9centertainmentÃ¢\\x80\\x9d did not work The distorted sound from the headset made watching any film impossible and the touchscreen system did not allow one to follow even the flight map Food was just about edible in spite of what the menu cards promised It was served in cardboard containers but bedecked with linen tray cloths and a set of cumbersome metal cutlery The return was another story On boarding we were warned that alcohol service would be restricted as the outbound flight had virtually drunk the plane dry Personally I did not find this a problem on a night flight However cabin service this time was sparse to say the least With the dinner bread rolls were not offered beyond the first two rows and there was no chance of refilling the miniscule Ã¢\\x80\\x9cchinaÃ¢\\x80\\x9d coffee cup The muchvaunted liqueur service turned out to be a glass of brandy  no choice Sleep was impossible The seats had obviously been designed for a greater pitch than had been afforded If the person in front employed the Ã¢\\x80\\x93limited possibilities for reclining their seat the surrounding design ensured that you were trapped in yours If you used the footrest your knees almost hit your chin Breakfast was similarly awful I am relieved to say that being at the front of the queue for boarding and disembarkation did have its advantages but I feel obliged to report to others that I regard the Premium Economy service that we received a vast waste of money One would do far better to purchase extra legroom seats in Economy Class and investigate taking some of the excellent locallyavailable snacks to sustain one on the journey To say this service is overhyped is an enormous understatement We are contemplating another visit to Cuba but are giving serious consideration to extending our journey time and using Dutch or German carriers', 'My Wife and I are villa owners in Florida and travel back and forth on Virgin Atlantic two  three times per year In the past five years my wife and I have seen a major decline in the poor quality of service and the introduction of the new cramped seat in Premium seats We have just returned from Orlando to Gatwick on 25th April 15 What we experienced was cramped seats touching my knees when the passenger in front reclines tired rude staff my audio jack in my seat was broken so I could not watch a film Overheated dried out food We were seated upstairs towards the front on P Economy with 40 economy seats behind full of loud unruly children and parents The crew were also handing out free champagne to the upstairs economy even though they had not paid for this service I feel that Thomson Airways new B787 Premium Economy is leaps ahead in qualitycost and comfort compared to Virgin Atlantic and I have already booked my return flights with Thomson in August 2015 to return to the US', 'I just arrived in London on VS602 from Johannesburg These are the worst T economy long haul seats one could ever have the misfortune to encounter The pitch is supposedly 31 but I bet it is less When someone reclines their seat the video screen is literally in your face The top back of the seat curves inwards putting your upper back and neck in a very uncomfortable position The minute I sat down in this seat I felt uncomfortable This is an 11 hour flight and these seats are not even suitable for a few minutes My back is sore now I am an average height male 18m and weigh 80kg Yes I am not a small child but I have flown most other long haul carriers in economy and none were ever this cramped and uncomfortable It is really a shame because cabin staff were good and the food acceptable for economy But the thought of spending another second in those torture devices fills me with dread I will avoid VA economy long haul at all costs I am so sorry I did not book with another airline', 'I am 510 and I had no leg room on an 11 hour flight  extremely uncomfortable The staff were fine the in flight entertainment was fine the food was ok for economy but the seat itself was horrible and I will not fly Virgin economy again My connecting Aer Lingus flight from Dublin to London had more room than my 11 hour Virgin flight from London to Shanghai', 'After Premium Economy from LGW to Barbados BGI and back again felt that the extra money was worth it Glass of bubbly before takeoff with significantly better seats than Economy in terms of width and space in front Even when the seat in front had fully reclined it did not bang into my knees and I could adjust the PTV angle to continue viewing Aperitif meal with drink and a digestif made for a better service Service was excellent with the benefit of having fewer passengers to serve On the night flight returning we were on the last row before the partition and could fully recline for sleep I am not tall 59 but fairly bulky but felt absolutely comfortable in the seat Will definitely book this class again based on my experience', 'I am 63 and 16 stone and found the seat very comfortable Having flown economy on the way to New York I found the upgrade on the way back to be well worth the money the staff on the plane were very friendly and very professional Have used Virgin before and will most defiantly use in the future', 'After having flown Air NZ premium economy from Auckland to San Francisco we were incredibly disappointed in Virgins premium offering by comparison We flew from Vegas to Gatwick and chose to pay for the upgrade as we wanted more space more service and to feel rested on arrival There is no lounge access the seats are cramped the service was pretty ordinary  and we felt very disappointed If this is premium I shudder to think how small the economy seats are I am not a big person and whilst I could stretch my legs out  the reclined seat in front of me made it almost impossible for me to get in and out You definitely want an aisle seat  I was in a middle seat The head rests move when you try to put your head weight against them I think you would be much better off paying for more legroom and extra luggage in economy if available  it would be cheaper and much the same result The seats are definitely wider than standard  which was the only really positive thing I can say about it They even charge you if you want more sparkling wine in the flight  hardly a premium service Got virtually no sleep', 'I am really shocked with Virgin Atlantics standard to say they have slipped is putting it mildly I think I would go far as to say they are one of the worst transatlantic air lies I have even flown and I fly a lot The seats were terrible so uncomfortable and you were shoe horned into a tiny space for 11 hours The food was awful borderline inedible and the staff were ok Just ok not fantastic service but not awful TV offerings were not great pretty disappointing especially their offerings for children The childrens food was again inedible meaning my 7 and 4 year old had nothing to eat the entire journey as they did not even have child snacks for kids like crisps or popcorn With all the schedule changes our flight was changed by 3 hours they did nothing to accommodate us when we complained In fact their customer service agents at their call centre were down right rude and had no clue I have to say they are turning into the new Ryanair  nothing to be proud of Virgin Atlantic', 'We flew from Hong Kong to London Heathrow on 190215 This was a 13 hour flight We were shocked when we boarded the plane and discovered how small and restricted the seats were and how they was virtually no leg room I am only a 54 tall female and I had a panic attack when i sat down in my seat next to where the window should be there was no window I could look out of just the fuselage I cannot describe just how restricted the seat was it was the sort of seat you would expect to sit in on a budget airline short haul flight not a supposedly reputable airlines long haul flight The chairs in front were practically on top of us and our chairs hardly reclined so needless to say we did not get any sleep We had no idea how small these seats would be Passengers then tried to go and sit in the empty extra legroom seats as the plane was taxiing towards the runway and some minor disputes occurred The cabin crew did not have a handle on the situation and to our surprise concentrated on taking extra payment from these customers so they could sit in these seats with apparently extra legroom instead of directing them to return to their seats whilst the plane was moving Overall this was the worst flight we have ever flown on and we are sorely disappointed that Virgins standards have plummeted They are clearly only interested in money making and have no regard for their passengers comfort or for attracting repeat business', 'Flew from Miami to Heathrow on 15th February This was the worst flight I have ever been on We paid for extra leg room seats Yes we had extra leg room but as the extra leg room was also the queuing area for the main toilets my feet were constantly trod on and I had to keep my feet tucked tightly into the seat The four main toilets were about two feet from my seat They were constantly in use and many times the users would open the door before flushing the toilet The smell was awful There was a curtain to block my direct view into the toilets but staff kept it open even after I had asked if it would be closed during sleeping time Many people coming out of the toilets used my seat head rest to hold on to and elbows were inches from my head There was nowhere to put personal belongings I was handed a meal tray and then I had to pull a very old tray from the side of the seat to place it on and then told I must fasten my seat belt This was a task requiring many hands The staff were off hand and spent a lot of time chatting First and last time on Virgin Atlantic', 'VS201  Hong Kong to London  7th Feb 2015 As another commentator has stated here there is something about these premium economy seats making them just not that comfortable Perhaps it is the low placement of the foot rest limited recline fatigued cushioning or the adjustable headrest wings which give way as soon as a head rests upon them An additional issue is the placement of toilets on this plane none of which are in the premium economy section which might be an inconvenience if the plane is full resulting in more demand and a longer occupancy of the aisles by cabin crew performing their duties I guess the extra fare does not equate to a proportionally improved flying experience Cabin crew were excellent', 'We spent around GBP300 each to come back overnight from Barbados to Gatwick in Premium Economy seats 22HK and 23HK None of us got a wink of sleep on this 8 hour flight Not sure why but these seats which I found very comfortable on a day

you are of average size or more avoid Virgin like the plague', 'On our return flight Orlando to London Gatwick we prebooked 4 economy seats on the upper deck No mention was made to us when checking in that our seats had been switched for 4 centre seats one row from the back of the plane When we complained we were told firstly it was a light flight and we had been moved to spread the load more evenly but would be able to move to vacant seats once plane had taken off On the actual flight the captain advised that having received a number of complaints that the upper deck was not being used due to a broken lift Whatever the reason we had a very uncomfortable flight siting so close to the toilets and subjected to both the toilet smells every time the door opened and people queuing to use the toilet all night On top of this we were last to receive any food and by this time there was only turkey left and we had no choice of menu by the time service reached us The final straw was being left with my uncollected breakfast tray despite twice having requested it is removal until a few minutes before we landed when it was finally taken of me I will not be flying virgin again', 'I have always chosen virgin in all my international travels but this will be the last time In the past I have always been able to reach below my seat and have been able to view the TV screen without any problem However on this trip San Francisco to London I had to contort my body to reach down to he limited space I could not even fit my small purse and shoes under the seat in front of me without it spilling out to my foot space When the person in front of me leaned back his seat there was no way for me to view the screen without bending down If I needed to use the toilet I had to use acrobat skills to even get out of my seat This was by far the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on The only good part was the service I feel as though in the past 3 years virgin has seriously gone downhill in quality As a result they have unfortunately lost my service with it', 'We enjoyed our flight with Virgin Atlantic plenty of room we did purchase two seat plus seats and this worked very well for us with a 3yr old The cabin crew were very friendly and happy they served us well and the food was very good', 'Holiday to Florida flight experience was horrendous both out and back from back

flight from Newark to Heathrow Virgin Atlantic changed our seat numbers to accommodate a family which is fair enough families should sit together The seats we were allocated were awful behind the bulkhead seats  DE The family immediately reclined their seats and had no consideration for others It was difficult to see the screen due to the close proximity it was extremely uncomfortable we struggled to get out of the seats due to the recline Virgin should have put some thought into the fact that we were inconvenienced but they could not care less I feel let down by Virgin and will probably shop around with other airlines in the future Another annoying factor was that we were in the second to last cabin and there was no hot food choice by the time the cabin staff reached us Overall a very poor service', 'We paid extra for premium economy seats as a treat from london gatwick to las vegas I have always been a huge virgin fan but this will be the last time we fly with them The seats are not that comfy although wide An hour into the flight the couple in front of us fully reclined their seats There was so room and myself and my 6 foot 6 husband had to sit with our legs at 90 degrees for the rest of the flight I could not even get out to go to the loo there was such little space and spilled drink over myself in the process It was extremely claustrophobic I was hoping the return journey would be better but the audio did not work to my entertainment screen The flight attendant offered me a portable DVD player which i had to balance on my tray in an already cramped space I flew virgin premium economy a few years ago and in my opinion they have placed more seats in the area to fit more people in as i do not remember feeling that cramped before On a positive note all the flight attendants looked polished but im they have now lost my custom to Emirates or BA', 'Seats are narrow with little legroom If person in front reclines you have zero legroom Food was

from ideal economy seats for a long haul flight  you book Virgin with the expectation of getting something a little better but this is definitely not true anymore with economy Very modest incline on the seat certainly no where close to feeling like a natural sleeping position Just about enough leg room for me as a 58 tall man but in some seats the seat mounting will stop you being able to stretch out Food was average  standard meal tray with a cold starter pasta salad rubbery bread roll and a small hot element either lasagna or chicken which reminded me of a cheap ready meal Second meal was a cold snack consisting of a very small sandwich and a very small packet of premium crisps Other than that got one hot and one cold drink service with and just after the main meal Our plane had being recently refitted so the new touch screen entertainment system was in place and I have to say this was excellent with a very good selection of recent films and TV Very small screen but this did not matter so much in economy as you are never too far away from the seat in front Other than that the cabin in the 747 was starting to show its age which I guess was not surprising considering it has being flying since 2001 I would not go out of my way to book Virgin again', 'LGWLAS Priority boarding and an alcoholic beverage served as soon as you were seated The seat is wide comfy and there is plenty of leg room to stretch out The recline is lovely too because it really does enable you to doze off at will The food that was served was perfectly fine and filling IFE is superb It caters for all tastes and after your meal and just a little too much to drink you can drift off into one of Hollywoods latest offerings something from TV a game of football or catch up on the latest news Premium economy reviews should not make the mistake of comparing to business class it is not a flat bed What it is though is a very comfortable seat with great service and fantastic IFE Its so worth the extra money', 'Gatwick to Barbados on the 747 and had a very comfortable flight The return flight on the A330 was a different story I have never been so uncomfortable on a long haul flight The seats are hard they do not recline very well and there is nothing to support your head when you want to sleep On the 747 the head rests come round so you have something nice to lean on and the seats seemed more padded The A330 seats were so hard not even my 7 year old got any sleep The entertainment is okay but nothing to write home about and the food was pretty awful I used to think Virgin were the best but having flown Emirates a few times Emirates are far superior In future I will avoid flying Virgin', 'We used the twilight check in service which was fast and efficient and made such a difference at

shoulders had to be curled forward like a racecar as I could not flatten my shoulders completely To exit the seat row I had to bend at a 45 degree angle The cabin and seat was clearly ageing The seat base was saggy and as the pocket was saggy it used up even more of the limited space Tv buttons took a lot of effort to press due to wear and the screen was not properly aligned which meant I had to angle my head inwards about 30 degrees to be square on', 'Flew LHR to Cape Town own What is all the hype about Virgin This was the worst flight ever I fly regularly to South Africa The seats were narrow and cramped No legroom at all Food was dreadful and very small portions Offered a drink only once during flight Aircrew not at all customer focused Food almost thrown at you No smiles please or

acknowledgement from cabin crew The plane had already been delayed by 15 hours and we also spent 45 minutes waiting on the ground before we could take off so by that point we felt quite neglected really The pilot did acknowledge why we had been delayed but stated there had been a Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmajor technical faultÃ¢\\x80\\x9d with the plane Ã¢\\x80\\x93In flight my partnerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s TV kept cutting out and in the end froze for the remains of the flight so he had to read instead I had last flown with VA ten years ago and have memories of comfortable seats adequate leg room attentive staff and good food I do not know what they have done but I felt they have economised on all the above areas On the return flight to London the pilot was very pleasant and reassuring speaking to us on a few occasions and acknowledging turbulence Also although the TVs are temperamental the selection available of films and programmes is excellent really I agree with the person above who suggested that the emphasis is now on PE However as I cannot afford to travel PE I would shop elsewhere in future to see if it is still possible to travel Economy in comfort', 'SFOLHR round trip The seats were comfortable and FA attentive For a long haul flight we totally recommend PE great selection of movies The food was adequate and the only this missing was a plug for your laptop or phone', 'My husband and I flew premium economy from Cancun to LGW It was a truly horrendous experience that I would not wish anyone to repeat The legroom was fine until the person in front reclines their seat I was left with no room for my legs and had to have them parted around the seat in front The meal was served late lights out was only for a couple of hours on an overnight flight and nothing was done about people yelling and being rowdy during lights out The food was so awful that I turned down the second meal Seats can be booked 3 months in advance which is awful We encountered several couples who were unable to sit together including a honeymooning couple because there were no seats left in pairs A truly awful airline', 'MelSyd Economy seat 25A As flight was near full having a window seat was a good choice Seat width was wider than on an A320A330 or A340 and it was a welcome change not to feel so compressed in terms of the seat area and legroom The downsides however were the constriction from the left side wall tapered inwards from shin to toe and headroom when standing to get out Cabin felt dated despite the aircraft being younger than 5 years  this came about due to visible cracks in the plastic fittings as well as rather old looking mould on the seat in front and no tv screens anywhere', 'Sat in seats 80H and 80K the last row of the upper cabin on a flight from London to San Francisco Seats barely reclined because we were situated right in front of the bathroom The seats were really hard to get in and out of especially once the person in front of me reclined her seat Once that happened it was also difficult to see the TV screen in the seat back Sitting near the bathroom was also bad because of the smell I had avoid flying Virgin Atlantic economy for long haul flights at all costs On the trip SFO to London we paid 50seat extra for 3 of extra legroom which was worth the money for such a long flight', 'The seats are narrow hard and very uncomfortable Legroom is average but the seat pocket is in a position that it limits your space This was the most uncomfortable seat I traveled in a very long time', 'The flight was delayed by 6 hours the plane was a nice feel as it was new if someone reclines their seat it goes right up close to your face and the person that was in front of me reclined his seat from the second the seatbelt sign went off to the second the flight attendant had to tell him The entertainment system was good touch screen and new technology on the A330 A sorry would have been nice for the FA spilt the cup of tea when collecting my tray just one of the great features of my wonderful flight to London The FA was more interested in her colleagues night out than unlocking the toilet after take off', '13D DARMEL exit seat LOADS of leg room but there are seats in front Comfort is good but can feel not so on 4hr flights Armrests seem quite weak do not stay upright if you want to lay down but you still can Exit seats do not recline which is a pain But if the plane is not full then its all good you can stretch out', 'LAXBNE Premium Economy seats were very comfortable had ample leg room and the 3position leg rest was really nice The front row just gets a cushion for their feet after takeoff I prefer the leg rests the other rows have as they are adjustable The recline was pretty generous and I did not feel too crowded when the

in the top position I was almost all the way stretched out I am 56 I found it very comfortable For 2 people the side rows are great They are just two seats and we felt like it was our own little area

of but I did not have any problem with getting in or getting out of my chair Also the service that I received while on the aircraft was very good on both outward and returning back to the UK I flew from LHR to LAX last October I do not believe that I was just lucky My last comment is if you do not like virgin then I wish you all the best on united', 'The seat on virgins 747 was uncomfortable to say the least The armrests were miniscule and a TV remote would have been better If the person in front of you is a total jerk and has no respect heshe can lean their seat all the way back and make it impossible to see your TV or even move Getting into the seat is very difficult and you have to bump into the fellow passengers', 'SFOHeathrowSFO Premium Economy seating was good Leather seats that reclined The flight to Heathrow was full crew was friendly and professional The food was nice and the amenities wonderful The crew on the flight to SFO were a bit more flustered even though premium economy was sparse They seemed to forget about me on a few occasions not asking if I wanted things taking away other things making sure I was in premium economy and not economy etc They were definitely flustered As someone mentioned previously I also noticed the premium economy bathrooms were opened to all in economy though the business class bathrooms were offlimits to premium economy passengers I would fly premium economy again as what I saw of the economy seats were awful', 'The seats were so narrow that it was impossible to move without either switching on the light or calling the steward Lack of cushioning on seats mean a numb behind after a few hours', 'SYD to LAX return return flight was seat 38F Found legroom and recline on V Australias 777 superior to others Seat was a

flight from MELLAX the seat cushioning became intolerable We did everything from placing pillows  blankets under our bottoms  thighs to regular position changes  walks around the cabin Whats the use of having the widest seats in economy across the pacific if they afford very little comfort in seat cushioning', 'I have travelled Virgin Atlantic for over fifteen years I usually take between three and five flights a year with them If the there was no loyalty scheme I would not fly with them anymore Heres why  the seats in economy are small and have limited legroom 31 inches They no longer offer any of the great benefits they used to The amenity kit has gone and the meal has been reduced to its most basic form Anyone who flew Virgin in the good old days would be amazed at what it is turned into I have flown all three classes and the emphasis is now all about Premium and Upper Virgin is all style over substance these days It all looks amazing in their fancy commercials but the reality is that if you can only afford to fly economy they really do not care about you', 'These are by some distance the most uncomfortable seats I have ever endured in an aircraft The seats are on the small and narrow side but the overriding issue is how hard they are and the position they force your lower back into whether you recline your chair or not After only 2 hours I was in pain To put this in context I have taken flights lasting up to 15 hours and have never been moved to complain about my seat before I will never fly Virgin again', 'SFOLHRSFO Old seeming plane Premium Economy was not worthwhile No amenity pack on return Filthy toilets but nice FAs Pretty uncomfortable overall Also Premium Economy toilets were avail to all Economy passengers', 'Premium economy Las Vegas to Gatwick Cabin staff good the rest of Virgin Atlantic do not give a damn after they have your money When you complain they just give you a corporate answer and brush you off with any of the excuses they have for each situation You pre assign seats and rarely get what you ask for you ask why and they tell you its an aircraft change even though the layout is the same They are untrustworthy I have given them many chances but they keep letting me down', 'I am slim but had to wedge myself into the seat With the TV control in the side of the seat you have to get out of your seat to get it Was so cramped that I did not bother getting up on the flight out or back which was unhealthy Very uncomfortable Virgin is now a budget airline without the budget prices', 'Outward flight seat in Row 42 opposite crew

partner was not so lucky She spent the entire night flight with her arms crossed as the passengers either side of her had taken both arm rests Virgin Atlantic Why does Virgin Atlantic online check in system not work and why are they offering four seats on a plane that even slim people cannot sit comfortably in If any passenger is offered a middle row 31 seat and is larger than a size 8 to 10 for

my TV screen was too close to my face her seat invaded my personal space and had it not been a night flight I would have complained Premium economy on Virgin A340s is not worth the money the space is too small when the person in front decides to recline their seat', 'If you have a larger than average body shape do not bother with Premium Economy  you will need upper class Premium Economy seats have the controls for TV and audio built into the inside of the armrest so cannot be accessed if you are wedged into them I was unfortunate enough to have a box under the seat in front so could not stretch out at all My seat was far too narrow for me and I had to keep getting out of it during an 8 hours flight it made my journey horrendous I upgraded on the return leg to upper class which cost an unacceptable amount but I felt that there was no option It should be noted that the Premium Economy seating does not have moveable armrests and being fixed makes this worse Economy seats do have some movement on the armrests but only to 34 posiiton', 'London to Boston and for the first time upgraded to their premium economy  seats were comfortable and spacious The downside on the return leg when the passenger in front of me fully reclined his seat for the entire flight which made my space feel encroached', 'Virgins Premium Economy seats are twice the price What you get is more seat width legroom and recline better service some better food and booze The problem is that the armrest between the seats takes up a lot of space and cannot be lifted up So if you travel with kids or even a spouse there is a lost opportunity to get more comfortable The kids cannot lie with their heads on your lap ever in premium economy The seats recline more than economy but it does not matter Its still not enough and the seats in general are quite uncomfortable', 'We were in basic economy on the flight out plane half empty so we were told to sit where we liked  on the way back same half empty but crew were charging GBP30 for window seats  they told us it was an upgrade', 'Seat appalling  tiny falling apart TV screen a joke Food  do not ask', 'Very hard and uncomfortable seats on a long haul flight recline was poor no head rest sides to fold in to prevent your head from slipping Very poor tv grainy and small and trying to remove the remote from the armrest with someone sat next to you is not the easiest Trying to move in and out of the seat also proved a challenge Have been in more comfort with budget airlines', 'Upper deck standard economy seat Seat in front is about 10 from your face when reclined Way back paid Ã‚Â£120 for pair of exit seats No legroom worries or chair in the face worries but narrow as tables take up space between I had to get physically out of my seat to get at any of the controls Ridiculous and incredibly uncomfortable', 'Flew Virgin from Johannesburg to Heathrow sitting in Row 80 on the upper deck I used to fly Virgin very regularly between London and the US but have not flown with them in the last 4 years and I have definitely noticed that the quality of the seating has deteroriated over that time It almost feels like you are flying with a budget airline with the way Virgin have tried to cram every spare inch with a seat I would be interested to know if they have changed the dimensions of the seats and the lefroom in the previous 4 years The other minus point was the quality of the service The flight attendents could not have been more uninterested if they tried  it was very obvious that all they wanted to do was to feed the passengers and get to the back to chat with the other attendents I would not fly Virgin again and based on this trip would not recommend them to anyone either', 'Seats are very hard and uncomfortable you will need the pillow to sit on or put behind your back for more comfort', 'Seats 20HK SydneyHong Kong Footrest on seat in front not good Fare only good for extra 5 inches of seat pitch  not when front and

had the docking position for the entertainment controls on the inside of the armrest making it very hard to remove  replace while sitting down The aircraft on the flight over had this under the screen which was far more sensible My reading light seemed to be aimed right in between the seats and could not be adjusted', 'I will never willingly travel Virgin Economy again after an excruciating 12 hours flight from London to Shanghai I checked out the Premium Economy on my way out of the plane and have upgraded for my return flight because could not stand another 12hour flight in those uncomfortable seats I think they were the hardest I have ever sat on Felt similar to flying Easy Jet but those are normally a 2 hours flight so your bottom does not go numb I resorted to using my inflatable neck cushion to sit on The other problem was the lack of a foot rest Having recently suffered DVT it was important not to have my legs hanging down for 12 hrs even though I wear stockings and walk around every few hours Virgin had told me incorrectly that there would be one I think it is irresponsible to have seats with no foot rests on long haul flights given the incidence of dvts occurring after these flights raising your legs helps the venous return All in all a terrible experience', 'Seat pitch on this newish A340 was nowhere near the advertised 32 inches It could not have been more than 30 inches Remote for the video froze up twothirds through the flight  could not even turn my reading lamp on No predinner drinks no offers of drink refills during dinner Asked for a napkin with breakfast muffin and fa told me we do not have any in this aisle although they do in the other aisle and left it at that My first experience with VS and not a positive one']\n"
